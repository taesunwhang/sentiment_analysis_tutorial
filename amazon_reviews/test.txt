__label__1 not worthy of the paper it's printed on!: This is a pathetic excuse for a book. Mr. Stratton seems delighted to stuff his pages full of all sorts of useful info on how to fight your pitbull ( a FELONY) and not get caught; how to befriend your local vet so that he will sew your dog back together without telling on you; and how to isolate your dog and degrade him into the agressive killer you wish he was. It is a sad commentary that this book does nothing more that feed the inhumane frenzy of scary, powerless men and women turning a defenseless puppy into an agressive fighting machine to make themselves feel big and strong. YUCK! Both the publisher and AMAZON continue to carry this book built on some first amendment call to arms. Let's have a reality check: this is no Ulysseus! Perhaps Mr. Stratton's next book can combine freedom of speech with the responsibility one should have toward innocent animals of all kinds. Why put sick work like this into the hands and minds of dangerous people?
__label__1 one of the poorest: One of the poorest excuses for a movie i have ever seen. I could believe it. Deleted it before it was finished
__label__1 Avoid the remix. Read the originals: This is a fictional piece of work that blends together several much better written books. It is supposed to be from a 12 or 13 year olds view. Sometimes the writing is what would expect from a teenager and other times, the writing is in a very different style. Read the original books and you will gain more information on adoption from China.
__label__1 Visit Bruce Damer's Website: With all due respect to Mr. Damer, this book is basically an introduction to what Avatars and Virtual Communities are. Mr. Damer provides a guided tour of several online communities. One or more of thewe worlds no longer exist. This is another example of web-time and how difficult it is to publish a book with a technology topic. I found the book very basic. Visit his web site to learn all you need to know and be introduced to the awesome online worlds. . . and save some money.
__label__2 Xlear - SpryMints: These are basically the same mints my dentist was recommending as being good for your teeth. They have no sugar, are refreshing and much less expensive than the dentist's mints. They also help with dry mouth.
__label__2 great for insect bites!!!: I've used this ointment for years for any type of insect bites to stop itch and/or stinging.When I could no longer find this in the stores I went to Amazon.com.
__label__2 More pop than vol. 1, but some great songs anyway.: This is obviously an intentionally more pop-sounding album, but it still contains some gems, especially "We're All Light"- what a great song! I've been following Patridge's and Moulding's careers for years now and I guess I'd have to say that it's not quite up to par with their best stuff ("Big Express", "Skylarking", "Oranges...", "Nonsuch", "AV vol. 1") However, compared with the garbage that people actually subject themselves to on MTV, etc, it's a pop masterpiece. Long live XTC!
__label__1 Horrible. does not clump.: the reason I pay or buy clumping litter is for ease and control. This did not clump at all. Very disappointed. This did not clump the urine, so it just sank in a mush to the bottom of the box. The odor was horrible, even with alot of attention.
__label__1 too small: This is simply not practical! a wast of money. It could only fit the camera and you cannot even think of fitting in the cords and so forth. It is so frustrating that I had to buy a new one. And buyers, beware of the battery. It was completely useless to my camera model! I regret every bit of the product.
__label__1 Basic and unmoving. Unoriginal.: With the caliber of musicians playing on this album, I expected a hard hitting original. Instead we get re-arranged covers and lots of "filler" salsa. No surprises here. The classic salsa albums are worth your cash but if you are curious, you'll play this one once.
__label__1 steamer: This streamer lasted only a few months. First, the timer numbers started to disappear and them the thing stopped working altogether. I followed all instructions but this is not intended to be used often and I like steaming my vegetables and potatoes. I replaced this with a pot with a steamer insert. I will never go back to buying an electric steamer since this one was my second electric one.
__label__2 DIFFERENT, BUT CAPTIVATING: Viveca kept you intrigued as to what was going to happen next. Her mother was a very strong woman and your heart couldn't help but go out to her.It was different the way she wrote the book with different headings for the different people in it. I liked the way she did it. Her writing in this book reminds me of Elizabeth ann Michaels books. Both very good authors.
__label__2 Historically innacurate but entertaining: Despite the gross inaccuracies concering the depiction of the Satsuma rebellion, I very much enjoyed this movie for its likable characters, honest portrayal of human relationships, and laudable themes. Tom Cruise (whose work I do not enjoy as a rule) appeared to be quite comfortable in his role. The real star of the file was Ken Watanabe, who walked the fine line between warrior and philosopher. My only other complaint with the film was that we never really established who the title character, the last samurai, was; perhaps this would've given this film that last vital shove into greatness.Better luck next time.-N
__label__2 Love it!: Thumb drives sure have come a long way in a short time. I paid 12 bucks for this item at a local store, which was funny to me because in November of 2007 I paid $11 for a 128MB DaneElec drive. Sure there are bigger ones out there, but for me 4GB is sufficient for carrying projects and papers between home, work and school. My HP Pavilion DV7 recognized it right away, as did the Dell desktop at my college, it could not be easier to use.
__label__1 A disaster !: First, let me start by saying that I do order quite frequently from Amazon and the reviews are always a huge help. My husband and I decided to purchase this unit b/c of the reviews.My husband worked on the unit for a week and could not get the dialer and the alarm to work in sync. When he called the customer service number, twice he left a message and no one called him back. On the third time, he got a rep but she informed him that they were about to close and could not help him troubleshoot. I rated the unit a 1 because of the product and the absolutely horrible customer service.
__label__2 nice film: good photography and good quility movie. I enjoyed it before, decide to have it in my album archive. I reccomended for general public
__label__2 Amazon MP3 Bought Songs...Awesome!: Jah Jah City and Jah Blessing are by far the most awesome songs I have ever heard. Full of feeling and rythm, man you just can't ignore it, and it's message. Totally aweseome!
__label__2 This conditioner works wonderfully on my dry hair. ...: This conditioner works wonderfully on my dry hair. It leaves my hair very silky and soft and untangled. There are very few conditioners that leave my hair so healthy. I'd surely recommend this to all my family and friends.
__label__1 Improperly named book: Writers of Perl and XML books think that they're comedians. Hint: they're not. If I want some laughs I'll watch an old episode of Seinfeld-not buy this XML book.This book's title and the author's comments suggest that you can learn XML from his book without already knowing HTML. In fact, he tells the reader to "put away the wheelbarrows full of knowledge and predispositions you may have acquired about SGML, HTML ..." (page xi). And on the following page Simpson states that "in order to understand and use XML productively" you don't have to know anything about SGML or HTML. He's correct. But if you want to learn XML from 'this book' you do have to really know them. With everything he discusses, he does so by making reference to HTML. Thus the book is totally resistant to comprehension without this prior knowledge. In fact, a more appropriate title would be "XML for those who thoroughly know HTML"Under the new premises, this book is still way below average.
__label__1 What?: I can't even begin to describe my lackluster response to this book. If you could return a book because you didn't like it, I would definitely have returned this one.
__label__2 Fairly decent B-grade horror flick--with some flaws (of course): Can you think of any movies of this type that don't have at least a few flaws? This one does, but it still manages to keep you entertained.By far, the best actors in this nature-run-amok film are the tarantulas themselves. They were obviously trained for the picture; I remember reading somewhere (maybe it was in an encyclopedia) that tarantulas are the most intelligent members of the arachnid world and this movie really proves it!A tarantula's bite is rarely fatal but I have to wonder if any of the human actors and actresses in this flick were bitten during the course of filming. Hmm...
__label__1 Doesn't do the job: This book has a few good illustrations and the author does reprint some original descriptions, but the book is otherwise almost useless. He lists several species of ants not even known from the US as being found in California, but does not give locality citations. There are no identification keys in the book, making it useless for the entomologist or worker trying to identify ants. No range maps and very generic range descriptions limits the books value. I found it to be probably the worst regional ant book on the market.
__label__1 the Black book: this is an interesting film by quality film makers -- but the quality of the print on the DVD STINKS! Not sure where one can find a good clean print of this public domain film... However the vendor that shipped the DVD was excellent.
__label__2 Sublte and full of energy!: The band starts sailing from the subtle opening towards the storm of excitement. Mick's vocal is even more soulful than ever,and the band is coherent whatever tunes they play. Mick seems to be feeling very comfortable to sing close to his audience. After all these years, he proved that he's in the new phase, and has a lot more to share with his fans!! This is the must for all the Simply Red fans!!
__label__2 A BOLD FEMALE ADVENTURE-ONE WORTH SHARING!: Los Angeles teenage girls and their women writing mentors speak their minds on family, community, and society. Wow--these personal essays, story snippets, and poems ring fiercely true. A great read! Also, this book contains wonderful writing experiments for the reader to try. I tried them and loved them. What a terrific gift! Great to give to young girls, women, or anyone who wants to know what young girls and women are thinking!
__label__1 Yawn!: I could not even finish watching this movie! With Gary Cooper how could it go wrong? Trust me. It did. Not worth the viewing or the purchasing.
__label__2 perfect find; finally!: we have been looking for an economical conical burr grinder for months. we finally found the Capresso 560.01. it work fantastic and is amazing quiet. best buy out there for the money
__label__1 dirty ball?: The ball came within the time frame indicated at sale, but looked old/worn/dirty when I got it. I don't want to go through the hassle of sending it back though, but I hope the one I sent my friend for her birthday looked new!
__label__2 Interesting Famaily: "The Moonflower Vine" is a well-written good story. Three daughters growing up part-time on a farm and living in a small town during the year when their father was teaching all see life in a different way. The author's descriptions of culture at the time as well as the activities of the novel's characters are well done. This is a good story...maybe not classical literature but fun to sit down and read as Jetta Carleton tells it.
__label__2 GREAT DOCUMENTARY!: I just finished this documentary and it was AMAZING! I had no idea what these individuals went through. Interesting story and well worth the purchase. I recommend this to anyone who watches documentaries.
__label__1 Vote Against Change: Change can be good, but not change for the sake of change. I'll keep my old copies of Star Wars. I would rather a lesser quality than modified scenes.
__label__1 Little or no specific information in the book: I bought this book because I was seriously considering adding some solar elements to my current home, and I'm currently planning a new home that I wanted to incorporate as many features as possible. Unfortunately, this book did little more than gloss over the absolute basics about solar power. While it claims to include the equations you need to design a solar energy system, that claim is grossly overstated. Repeated throughout the text are reasons WHY solar energy is good for the environment, but the author has done more harm than good by producing a book that doesn't enable anyone to really go out and do it.
__label__2 A living Legend: I loved this book, and it contains amazing photographs of a beautiful woman.She is a legend and it's easy to see why...A+++
__label__1 Bad product at high price tag: I bought the TV in 2005. In 2006 the remote went bad, I waited 6 weeks for the extended warranty company to send me a new remote. The remote died again 2 weeks ago. Without coverage it would be cheaper to scrap the TV than to fix it. All in all a very bad and unrelable expensive product.
__label__2 Good: Got this for my Body Rider Fan Bike (on amazon) which the seat is pretty awful and this helps quite a bit.
__label__2 The Geek is Impressed: I picked this up for Xmas for my boy, and I did examine options to see that it had a blacker black and a faster refresh, because it's used for FPS games. The statistics don't do it justice. This monitor is impressively more responsive and clearer than any of my previous LCDs. I've had about eight from various manuf, and this is by far the best. It doesn't have any usb ports, or speakers, but what I was buying was a monitor, not a peripheral, and this is the best, and it's less than the competition. Highly recommended.
__label__1 BAD BACKSTREET BOYS: If you've ever seen a David DeCouteau movie (Brotherood, Leeches, Werewolves of New York) you know what to expect: a homoerotic mishmash of ridiculous plotting, hunky boys in skimpy underwear; and relentless padding consisting of slow motion swaggering and lots of pecs and abs. In RING OF DARKNESS, Adrienne Barbeau (Swamp Thing, Fog, Creepshow, Maude) plays the boy band's seductive manager who stages an audition to replace the band's lead singer who tried to leave them after he found out what the boys in the band were in reality. Barbeau does well as always, but the rest of the insanely attractive cast needs acting lessons badly. By the time you've figured out just what these hunks do to keep their looks, you've had to sit through some pretty derivative plotting and a predictably campy ending. DeCouteau needs to rethink his future projects and at least come up with more than just pretty bods.
__label__2 This is the best book I have ever read!: My Grandmother passed this book on to me in her will. It seemed like a strange thing to leave me but it has touched my life. Whenever things are going wrong or when I need a spiritual reawakening, I pick up this book. I have read it at least 50 times and it has never gotten dull or boring. I recomend it to everyone!
__label__1 Disappointed in Reliability of Garmin 305: The device is difficult to use for the average person and the manual does not give very good instructions. Also, I've had random problems. After taking a full charge, it shut down the next morning in the first 5 minutes of my workout. Then on my next workout, it showed the time and distance, etc... during the workout, but failed to record any of it to History, so the data couldn't be viewed later. I don't find the features described in the manual to be useful and trying to just use the basic feature of recording workouts seems to be hit or miss based on random problems. In trying to email customer support, I continually received notices that the system wasn't working and to try back later. I guess I'll try calling for support. I would not recommend this device.
__label__1 Sent me wrong DVD: I am disheartened to receive Ghosts of the Abyss which doesn't play in North America! Wrong language wrong DVD. I would like to receive the proper Zone when I order.
__label__1 Metal Gear Solid 3: Subsistence: The guide was missing some stuff that it said it had. It was supposed to have maps of where to find the kerotans, but didn't. It didn't even talk about most of the hidden stuff in detail. I was disappointed.
__label__2 wow...super book on a well done topic: I have been playing hold em since before it was cool...I learned a lot about the game which had never dawned on me. It is great because it has copious amounts of material for all level players. Very impressed. If you are a player it is a must own.
__label__2 first one i had lasted 20 apox years!: My first wahls hair cutting set lasted apox 20 year thinking where I lived when I got the first set! Time dose fly this I think will be the last one I need! Thanks
__label__1 Steven Spielberg's Greatest Disaster: This is one of the worst sequels ever made and released to the general public, this one should have been sent back and redone. What a bunch of junk. The characters in this movie are loud, stupid, and generally all unlikable, so when they get eaten the audience rejoices as if it were the second coming. This movie offers nothing new from the original really, more dinosuars and sillier people that's about it. There is nothing suspenseful or exciting here. The magical sight of the dinosaur effects has lost it's luster and even good actors have to hang their heads in shame after this one.Everybody has a bad movie on their resume, but Mr. Speilberg has to take credit for this one...poor guy.
__label__1 Don't waste your money!!: I ordered this product to replace another hot air brush I was using. I have worked in many salons where professionals have used Hot Tools products so when I read the reviews I didn't hesitate to purchase this. Upon receiving the product and opening the package, I immediatley thought it felt cheap. It is only 800 watts and it took forever to dry my hair, which is not very long or thick. After using it twice it stopped woking and smelled like it was burning. I wish I could return it, don't waste your money!!
__label__1 SHRINKS LIKE CRAZY - DO NOT BUY: I bought two of the pads for a Graco Pack and Play. I made sure to try them to ensure a good fit before washing them and pre-wash they fit perfectly. One cold wash and a tumble dry and they shrunk to the point where they no longer fit and are unusable. They are so small that they make the PNP mattress fold up on itself. A waste of money and I cannot return them now that they have been washed. Not sure what would happen with a cold wash and a line dry, but be warned.
__label__2 Master Lock 10D works fine: This lock's size could only be used to secure luggage. About the size of half your thumb. I thought it was bigger, but I didn't check the dimensions before I bought this lock.
__label__2 An excellent replacement for a Subaru front windshield washer pump.: This is an excellent replacement for a Subaru front windshield washer pump in a '00 Outback, as it fits perfectly and works very well.The installation is quick, remove the water bottle, pull the old pump and gasket, insert the new gasket and pump and replace the water bottle. Crimp the blade connectors to the wiring from the pump, insert the blade connectors into the original Subaru connector and you are done, took all of 10 minutes.The wiring from the pump is very long and they provide both spade connectors and wiring connectors ( since its a universal pump ).
__label__1 iPod speaker with docking station by CTA: I purchased 2 of these sound stage docking stations, which are marketed specifically for use with the iPod. Neither one worked properly. The iPods did not play through the station's speakers when docked - they had to be connected to the station with a cable for the music to play. Also, this docking station would not charge the iPods (one of the primary product features). A message displayed on the iPod screens stating that the devices were not compatible. This product was a total waste of money.
__label__2 Great Gadget: I'm very happy with it. I love data and it does a very good job of showing multiple gauges. Everything is easy to configure. Changing vehicles with it is a snap. It includes some velcro for mounting.
__label__2 THE BEST portrait of pop culture in the 90's!: From "Crappy Brown Carpeting" to "The Answer Is Plastic," every single chapter is a classic tale of America in the nineties. Lisick is a new kind of writer, an original. You must have this book! She expresses herself with a pleasant sense of humor, understanding, and the perfect touch of criticism! This fresh new style of writing and poetry will definitely put a smile on your face
__label__2 Thanks Lee Child!: One day whilst looking for books for my Kindle, I came across a Plaudit from Lee Child about an Author named Zoe Sharp, this was my Introduction to Charlie Fox. Killer Instinct is the first Book in the series. but was almost the second book I read. Killer Instinct takes place in England, and a lot of the Dialog reflects this, and in that I found the first thing I love about Zoe's books, she gives them such an amazing sense of Place. Reading this book, I actually felt like I have hung out in the Places she described and thus She made the story that much more gripping and exciting.The one thing I will bring up, only because 2 people I recommended the book to said the same thing, in the beginning of this Book I had a strong sense of forboding, which almost made me stop reading. Stick with this Book, and the series, You will not be sorry! I Love Charlie Fox's adventures, and I bet you will also!
__label__2 a great thriller: The story takes place in Mississippi. In the coastal town Biloxi, patients of Dr. Michael Sims are lost and sinister things are happening in the hospital. The other main character, Shannon Donnelly, tries to prove that her father, a congressman, did not commit suicide, but was murdered. With 'Donor' author Charles Wilson again shows himself to be a master of the medical thriller. Just like his excellent 'Embryo', this is a fast paced novel, well plotted indeed. If you firmly believe that a hospital is a safe place where sick people most of the time get well then 'Donor' will really scare you! The interesting thing about the book is that this, or something similar, really could happen in the near future. The novel shows how advances in medical science could backfire.
__label__2 Clear and Complete: Outstanding book, covers all topics with clarity. No fluff or hype. Excellent for organizing yourself, covering all bases. References other books for further info on specific items.
__label__1 wooden and woeful: I am a great admirer of Jack Lemmon in films like The Apartment and Missing. Kim Novak has done good work in Vertigo, for instance. But this film is truly awful. The script (even though the usually worthwhile Blake Edwards is given a credit in the screenwriting) is bereft of wit or sparkle, the "situation" around which the story is built is simply uninteresting and no amount of creeping up on it can make it more interesting. The directorial touch is leaden and that, perhaps more than anything, is the reason why I just could not watch it to the end. I was dozing off and my partner was already asleep by the time I reached for the remote control. Rarely have I been unable to watch a film to its conclusion. Save your money.
__label__2 Cast Iron. A good product.: I cast pewter alloys, and recover the scrap, remelt it, and pour it into ready-to-use ingots in this mold.It is one of those products made for a simple use that simply cannot fail to work, and RCBS has been making good quality products for a long time.Unlike the photo, the mold I got has the RCBS logo in reverse relief, so your ingots will have that logo engraved in them. I'm neutral on the issue, since I am casting them for my own remelt use, but if a customer were to buy raw materials from me, it would give me pause.The mold has a generous draft, and upon cooling, the ingots readily fall out. It'll last a forever with low-melting alloys, the price is attractive, and it's all good.
__label__1 Where Has The Classic Dokken Gone???: Dokken was my favorite band in my high school days.When they broke up i was very upset. Now they have tried to make comebacks. The problem is Dokken is not staying true to what got them near the top of the 80's rock heap. Erase the Slate has some of there best music in years, but the lyrics are horrible. Reb Beach's guitar playing is awsome, but the lyrics are bad. Dokken needs to return to writing lyrics like IN MY DREAMS, Heaven Sent, and Alone Again. Not one song on this new album is like those at all. I wish Dokken would stop trying to be a band they are not and return to the music that everyone remembers them for. The last time i saw them in concert, nobody wanted to hear any new stuff, the loudest the crowd got was when they played the classic good stuff. I would like to hear the Dokken that made a great album called Back For The Attack...Please Come Back!!!!!!!
__label__1 Not funny: I expected Ted to be funny. I got bored half way through and did not watch the movie to the end. I found this movie annoying, in your face and unsubtle. From the excessive dope smoking, swearing, crudeness, immaturity, self absorbance, just another Bro-mance tween movie....a lazy movie, not witty at all. I like the concept of the movie yet the product is another terrible Hollywood comedy. Shame, Mark Wahlberg has been is some really great movies (The Departed for one and more). This just wasn't one of them.
__label__1 Warning: I am going to write the warning I wish I had read before I started The Pursuit of Happyness. I read an article in a magazine about the movie and Will Smith. I was so intrigued by the idea of this self made man I asked for the book for Christmas. I was excited to start the book and it did start out well. When the author switches to Chris's childhood, it goes down hill rapidly from there. Graphic and disgusting language begins. By the time the book gets to Chris's puberty, it is all over for me. I am surprised that the editor did not clean up the lanugauge or edit graphic descriptions for clarity and readibility. There was so much grossness in description, that the story line was lost. I think as a work of literature, this book failed. There is definitly a story to be shared by Chris Gardner, but he chose the wrong co-author and editor to help him tell his amazing story.
__label__1 Not as Helpful as it could be: Very basic book, not a large section for what I wanted. There are much better study guides out there to use.
__label__2 Camel lites: I just saw this concert DVD for the first time (I've only been listening to Camel for nine months), and I have to say, I'm quite amazed. The video quality and editing is top-notch, the band is tight, the mix is good (perhaps a tad keyboard and reverb heavy, but this was the 80s), and is a good career overview leading up to '84.Stationary Traveller is moderately represented, and while it's not my favorite Camel album, the songs turn out much better live than the studio. Andy Latimer is the only original band member here, and plays guitar with an incredible amount of passion. It's somewhat similiar to David Gilmour's tone on a few tracks, but a little lighter and faster at times. He also provides the main vocals and occasional flute.Total Pressure is an expanded version of their Pressure Points VHS/DVD, and includes several bonus songs (almost 1/3rd is new here) and an interview from 1984-85.Highly recommended for fans of either classic prog or AOR. There's something to love for everyone.
__label__1 Go get another book if you want to pass the exam: This book gets one star because it does not cover the material required to pass the exam. I would have almost failed the exam had I used just this book for my preparation. Luckiliy I have used online questions from one of the web-sited listed on Microsoft's web-site and that helped me to pass the exam.The exam contains mainly case studies and this book gives only one of them from start to finish. The exam is mainly a comprehension sort of exam where you read the passage and answer the questions. So get a book that have those case-studies.
__label__1 what a crock: ours just broke at 2 years or less! and no problems?! broke out of nowhere.is this some sort of sick set-up that they programmed them all to break at the same time? i am guessing the failure has to do with the electrical start up since it isn't a manual turn on lever or anything.what a rip off. i am pissed and disgusted. i was happy with the iron's abilities and decided to investigate if there was anyway to fix it. but now i am so mad finding out the stupid thing was doomed to fail and now my warranty is up. and yeah, it was the most expensive iron on the shelf at the time and we decided to go for it, hoping it would last us many years.all i can say is UGH. why can't things be built to last anymore?
__label__2 Very nice book!: I purchased this gift book as a gift and have been told that it is one wonderful book to read-as long as you have a love for horses!
__label__1 Waste of money!!!!: I bought this griddle hoping to use it on days when I couldn't grill outside. The first time I used it, I made red snapper...it stuck horribly and I couldn't get it clean for anything! I finally got it relatively clean and reseasoned it. When I pulled it out it felt gummy and sticky. The small grilled potatoes stuck horribly to it even after I cleaned it again. I decided just to toss it and call it a loss. Would not recommend this at all!
__label__2 Works as advertised: No complaints so far, all software and hardware works fine. I'm using the Garmin for cross country skiing and on my stair master. Can't wait til spring to use it for cycling, the main purpose for the purchase.G
__label__1 A disappointment: This text was a major disappointment to read. The author uses so many "mights", "coulds", "maybes" and "perhapses" that it seems like a text in speculative biography. Maybe she did this. Perhaps she did that. This could have happened. It might have been the case...He claims that Jesus was not able to read or write, though most scholars give him some capacity for that. Frustratingly, he offers no reason for his statement. Also, he states that since Mary was possessed by seven demons it took Jesus at least a year to exorcise them all. Sadly I got so frustrated with his writing that I didn't even finish reading it. But my margins are riddled with question marks and exclamation points at parts where I was befuddled or frustrated.
__label__2 Works great, where's my rebate??: My sister who works with computers recommended this one to me, and it was fairly easy to set up, I think most people could do it easily with a little help. I have had no problems and get a good signal everywhere in my house. I am still waiting to hear about my rebate though, which was a small factor in my deciding to purchase it.
__label__2 This is a decent video: This video is a follow up to G N'R THE WORLD'S GREATEST ALBUMS APPETITE FOR DESTRUCTION. It tells the history of the band and it talks about their breakup. It's not as good as the TWGA dvd but it's a decent video especially for someone just getting into G N'R's music. The commentary from the interviewees is not always flattering or kind and Axl seems to get the brunt of their criticism. The interveiws with the various journalists are interspursed with shots of the original band playing at various locations.
__label__1 I haven't received it yet!!!!: I haven't received this item yet. It has already appeared on my credit card bill, though. I just wrote to the seller asking whether it had been shipped. How do I get my money back?CTA
__label__2 Citibank, 1812-1970 (Harvard Studies in Business History, 37: 12 Feb 2000Dear Sirs,A landmark in the writing of banker history for Citibank, a nation's most influential commercial and investment banking.After reviewed the book, it's my gracious to know the name of National City Bank be renamed to Citibank and Citicorp by Mr. Walter Wrision? The Author do not express further the name of Citibank achieve from? Why must Mr. Wrision renamed the bank to Citibank and Citicorp group and not other names? it the renamed name significance to the background of the center of the nation's banking system?Thank YouHarry Tan
__label__2 A MUST READ book about a history that haunts us today: All of our Asian issues (China, Japan, Korea,) have their roots in the conduct and actions of the Japaneese and the United States during and after WWII.TO ignore that is to ignore the impact of history. Asian parents still caution their children about the results of that war, and many older Asians feel that the United States missed the boat by hitting the Japaneese with only two Atomic Bombs.Make no mistake. The rise of Japan as a Economic power has scared everyone. The rise of them as a Military power is attractive to NO one in the region. And never will be. The Grandparents of the occupation and impact of the Japaneese military are still alive and their children have been raised to beware the boogyman.Reading this does put the entire element of the Political war in focus.
__label__1 worthless: Cable does not work for charging. Do not buy, this is worthless. This cable isnot from Microsoft Zune. The picture on the Amazon site is not this cable, thepicture is a Zune cable but this cable is not from Microsoft.
__label__1 Not for Macs: Incompatible with the new MacBook Pro. My Apple keyboard will not always work when plugged into this hub. I have to remove and reinsert it into my Mac. It's a nuisance.
__label__2 A new paradigm!: Go for No! is a must-read for anyone in any kind of sales or marketing position. It's a totally counter-intuitive way of looking at things, but it produces a much more positive outlook. Rather than looking at a potential customer's "no" as a rejection, you begin to see it as simply one more step toward a "yes." This book goes fast and is very interesting, as well as inspirational.
__label__2 Best water bottle ever!: I bbought this bottle for one handed no spill (or drip) stay cold, hold full size ice cube holding, easy clean operation and that is what I got. I would expect no less from THERMOS and that is what I got. I havn't tried it on hot (coffee)beverages yet but it will keep ice water with cubes cold in a locked car cold during a mid-July afternoom!
__label__2 They should call them Highest Yield!: I have purchased these cartridges twice from Amazon and they really last a long time. They are high quality ink and print beautiful photos. I have a Lexmark all-in-one printer, which is great!
__label__2 Fantastic!: I am 5'9" and find this paddle fantastic for kayaking. Plus it snaps apart into 2 little halfs making storage easy!
__label__1 stick with the George Foreman instead: My George Foreman grill stopped working in December--after a couple of days I ran to Macy's to replace it but they had none in stock. In desperation I bought the DeLonghi grill. I've lived with it for about 6 weeks and my conclusion is: IT SUCKS!!!! The George Foreman grill is not perfect but if you are happy with it do not switch to this grill. Yes, the DeLonghi is easier to clean but I'm more interested in cooking than cleaning and the DeLonghi is lame in the cooking department. The glass cover of the DeLonghi is BS--we don't want to steam the food--we want to grill it.
__label__2 Hank's Best: Yup this is a piece of genius, and has to be Hank's best im not gonna do a long review but imma leave it with this, this is a movie everyone loves, buy it
__label__1 Does not filter well:(: Returned this and ordered the Pondmaster 1250 instead. Had to clean the filter every fews days in contrast to the 1250 that I celaned out weekly. SO Disappointed. You get what you pay for.
__label__2 Happy Owner: Purchased for my husband's medical school graduation and we have been very happy with it. We've found that the coffee is still quite hot 2-3 hours after brewing and have no problems with pours or spills even when using in a rush at 4:30am every morning. Great coffee - no complaints.
__label__2 An Interesting READ!: I just finished reading "Wait for Love"....WHEW!!!! It has hills and valleys that I never hope to see, but it is a reality for some. The way Ms. Wanda wrote the book draws you into the story from the first page. In your quest for love, dear readers, learn from Ms. Wanda Hudson's book and "Wait for Love."
__label__2 Alphabet Theme-A-Saurus: Many, great ideas to teach the alphabet to very young children. Activities allow children to involve their fine and gross motor skills keeping their attention focused on the activity.
__label__2 27 tracks, 27 hits: While many people buy CD's for one or two favorite songs out of about 15, The Why Store delivers 27 tracks on one CD, a rarity these days, and they all rock. Dave Matthews fans will love this album.
__label__1 looks good doesn't last long: really liked the styling of this toaster and the reviews were good, but the reviews that were bad for this product are what I should have listened to. after only a few months the spring in the left side started getting weak and would not return the waffles all the way up. I then started using the right side and it has been better, but alas the spring in that side is weak as well. besides that the toasting quality is good but not returning the waffles back up thing is essential to my toasting of anything.
__label__1 coffeemaker: Top of the coffee pot is very hard to twist off. When you program the coffeemaker for in the morning that works, but the coffee does not stay hot like it is suppose to. Does not pour very good either. So we feel we have wasted our money. And it was not cheap. We are going to buy another coffeemaker.
__label__2 Best baseball title for the xbox to date: I rented WSB and MVP and felt that MVP is a better game for me. I am a very picky gamer, but after playing a few games I felt myself drawn to the gameplay in MVP. I don't have time to mess too much with the franchise models in any of these sports titles, so I get more excited about the gameplay. This game is truly excellent and I commend EA Sports for changing over from the Triple Play series. I believe the throwing meters are an excellent addition to the game of baseball. In my opinion, after reviewing all the baseball titles available to date for the xbox, you will not be disappointed with this title.
__label__2 Best kick scooter out there: This is my 3rd, for my 3rd child. They are sturdy and provide tons of fun. No issues with break down of any kind. Kids love them.
__label__2 One of Lang's best collections: While I love all of Andrew Lang's collections, I think this has to be one of my favorites. This is a collection that pretty much goes out of its way to collect every strange, exotic, and unknown tale on the face of the planet. Far from the simplicity of other tales, these are complex and detailed. Which probably means they were not passed down quite as much, but are wondrous and inspiring just the same
__label__1 BUYER BEWARE!!!!: The silver connecter that is on the cigerette plug in pushes in and will not connect. the cord is VERY THIN and does not put out much heat at all and broke the second time I used it. would not ever blow hard enough to defrost a window. Piece of Junk
__label__2 Great CD: The season one BTVS clips were only a small preview of the band's awesome vocal and instrument range. CDs rarely transport me to an artist show, but this one pulled off the trick nicely. Not only did I feel like I was inside the 'concert', but I also began searching for this CD.Dashboard Prophets space outside of the top 40 just leaves more room for fans who independently make up their own mind about music. This CD is heartily recomended for anybody wanting great music from a 'new' band that has not yet had the chance to soak the airwaves. All tracks are good, and there is nothing prompting a 'skip'.
__label__2 Underrated film-- Cult Classic today: Some of the online reviews bring to mind the snobbishness of the reviews in 1982. This film is brilliant in its silliness and slapstick humor. The thrust of the movie was not so much to "remake" Pirates of Penzance, but to update it and make the humor more accessible to a new group of people, as well as poking fun at those who believed that the now subtle humor of "Pirates of Penzance" was only for the "highbrow." Well, giving a bit of a background of Gilbert and Sullivan their humor at the time was aimed squarely at the rigidity and formality of the upper classes, and was considered slapstick, silly and highly accessible in its time. This movie pokes fun at the upperclasses, and was highly offensive to the reviewers of the time because of this. Sit back and enjoy it, but also realize that this movie does far more than simply make fun of Pirates of Penzance, Star Wars and Raiders.....
__label__1 Don't waste your time!!!: This is an example of one bad apple. A $5.00 book and they could not produce the product? I contacted these folks twice with no response. It's a shame that people like this give Amazon a black eye. Amazon did give me credit though.
__label__1 Buy something else....: My fiance got this MP3 player for Christmas. The buttons are not in a user-friendly layout and it's not easy to find the button you need. There is no carrying case or strap to make it easy to carry around...it [isnt good] if you want to use it to work out. Downloading music to it is not easy at all, especially for computer novices...and the worst thing, is that one day, it just stopped working completely...and we can't figure out how to fix it. I would recommend the [something else]...
__label__1 Interesting premise badly flawed: The basic premise of a group of women who can see the future one of who is captured by a pirate and forced to predict where a treasure convoy is going to be. Unfortunately there is more brutality than erotica. The only saving feature is an interesting Deau ex Machina conclusion. Overall not up to par for the genre.
__label__1 just ok...: Box was tore up thru shipment. Crate does not properly align on sides. Sides bow in opposed to lining up to keep a secure corner. Perfect size for our dog tho.
__label__1 Don't be fooled!!!!: This is not a travel book - even though everyone seems to be marketing it as one. It is a novel. As a novel it is passable but I wouldn't go out my way to read it.
__label__2 Hip-hop needs more of this: I copped this album at Borders, and I thought it was pretty damn ill. This isn't really stuff that the Wu normally puts out, but I don't mind. They mixed up RZA and GZA with some of my favorite underground artists (MF Doom, Aesop Rock, Del the Funkee Homosapien) and I think most of the tracks turned out good. I especially liked "Slow Blues," "Street Corners," and "Biochemical Equation." A couple of tracks didn't do much for me ("Cars on the Interstate") and they could have made "Preservation" longer (Del and Aesop on the same track!), but other than that, it's a solid album that's worth your cash.
__label__1 Scary! Not for Little Children!: My two children (ages 4 & 6) LOVE Wallace and Gromit. After reading some of the reviews, we thought they would enjoy this. Not a chance. "Creature Comforts" (the only Nick Parks animation on the video) went way over their heads. "Wad's Pig" was about the horrors of war, and "Not Without My Pocketbook" left them with bad dreams for a month. For adults, it's cute, 3-4 stars, for small kids, 0 stars and this warning! If you want something the whole family will enjoy over and over again, buy the Wallace & Gromit three pack.
__label__2 When Peter Cook and Dudley Moore were the kings of comedy: I bought this CD because my 33 album has been played so many times it has lost its crispness. Superb British comedy at its best.
__label__1 Animal Dreams: I returned this item to the sender. My order was for a new book. When my purchase arrived, it was yellow pages (obviously old) with a name written inside the cover page. It was used - not old. I returned it to the sender with a letter and asked for my money back. Have not heard from them as yet. I was very dissatisfied with this purchase, the first one that was not up to what I ordered from Amazon. So, I am out the cost of the book, the shipping fee for the book coming to me, and the cost of shipping to send it back. I was unable to take the one star off of the rating below - I would not rate this with any stars. Disappointing.
__label__2 A Worthy Follow up to "3EB": It took me 2-3 listens before I decided I liked it. This CD will take a few listens for you to get used to it. I particularily like the soft spoken "Slow Motion" and "Never Let You Go", "Anything" and "Darkness" has wierd guitar thing going on.
__label__2 This Fiberglass/Foam Board is a Good, Economical Upgrade from a Wood Board: I've been riding wooden boards for over 2 years now. I saw this board for sale and thought it was way too cheap for a full fiberglass/foam board - but I decided to take a risk and give it a try. It's a major upgrade from my wooden boards. With this, I can waveskim or sandride. It's very light weighing only 5 lbs, has a mild rocker, and comes with a limited lifetime warranty. It's not going to perform as well as $200 - $300 namebrand boards like Victoria, Exile, Zap, etc.; but for the price I paid I'm very happy.
__label__2 Worked like a charm: Very light and easy to carry in my backpack. My little girl was in the midst of a city street party and there was nowhere to go...she didn't think twice about using the Potette. Only problem is that the absorbent pad wasn't absorbent enough. In future, we will carry one of our left over diapers to place in bottom of bag.
__label__1 Don,t buy: I got this CD for free from Pepsi points. If I had spend money on it I would be really upset. If you a fan on vampire movies very disappointing. Reminded me on a bad version of Blade and Resident Evil in the 1800 Century. Don't waste your money if you really whant to see it, rent it.
__label__2 Love this product!!!!!: My mother-in-law had gotten a sample of and gave it to me to try, initially I thought it was way too greasy. (I think I used too much, a little goes a long way!) After the sample was gone my husband bought me some, I used it twice a day until it was gone. Not a huge fan of the $20 price tag, I decided to buy something cheaper at walmart. (Palmer's tummy butter...) After 5 days of using that, my belly itches like crazy!! I didn't realize how well the anti-itch stuff they put in this works! Now I will be making a special trip to the store to pick up more! Well worth the price, honestly.
__label__1 What a rip-off1: First, I was charged $3.49 for this item when it is clearly marked on the back as $1.50. Secondly it is a MINI-Book which is 4 X 6 inches and has 24 stickers in it that are tiny. What a rip-off. I am highly incensed that this was mis-represented. I expected a BOOK of stickers -- not a little insulting folder.Do not buy this --I would return it but it wouldn't be worth the postage.
__label__2 It's a perfect book to gain knowledge as well as skills,,,,: There are many reasons for having this book but let me relate to you what only two points did for me:Gradually I became stressed. I found it hard to concentrate on anything, even the things I once enjoyed -- Even watching a movie became a task. I was too tense to concentrate, which made it hard to remember anything. I avoided people because even talking became stressful. I became so tense at times that I had difficulty breathing.Then I got this book.The smile principle showed me that if I smile to others, others smile back. Afterwards I felt wonderfully calm and at peace with the world.Following that brought about throwing out a thing a day. Y, I tried it. It basically quietens your chattering mind, and reduces 'noise on the brain'.I can't _stress_ enough how vital this book is for conquering tension, stress, and emotional unrest.Get it for yourself and feel much better.
__label__1 Dead on Arrival - Euro Pro Ice Cream Maker: Like two other reviewers, my unit had the loud buzzing of one of the fans presumably in charge of the cooling process. I was (rightly) concerned when I placed the order after reading the negative reviews, but I thought I'd give it a chance, with Amazon's great customer service backing me.
__label__1 Dire picture quality!: Even for the die-hard collector of ballet films, Anna Karenina is a dubious investment. As other reviewers have said, the picture quality of this VAI release is terrible - dark, grainy and full of filmic flickers and sparkles. Recommended for fans of Maya Plisetskaya only. For other fans of ballet, save your money on this one.
__label__1 Great idea, but...: It is an excellent device for power point presentations... But after ONE MONTH of use, it did not want to work anymore. Only the laser still works, but, who wants that huge pointer without the mouse...?One more thing: The trigger should be the laser pointer, and the middle button should be the "previous slide" button. Iogear may build a fantastic tool if they follow this modest suggestion...
__label__2 funfunfuntillherdaddytookthetbirdaway: this game is a blast. a total escape and easy on the eyes and temperment. Love to experience all the different places in a rockin vehicle and the gas is really cheap! It's a blast and I play all the time.
__label__1 no no no: The other reviewers shown here must of watched a different movie. This film should have never been released. low quality poor acting. Just plain bad!
__label__1 I've seen much better: The two skeins of yarn didn't match, and there were knots and unevenness such as loopsin the skein I used.
__label__1 Alas, the end is near: I've been a Metallic fan since Ride the Lightning and, unfortunately, this album tells me that the band has definitely peaked. For me, their swan song was And Justice For All, although all subsequent albums had their moments.But this CD ... wow, what to say other than it's just not very good. The songs range from so-so to so-what. And the production values ... what the hell happened there? The entire CD sounds like they've recorded it during an impromptu jam session. Or worse, an early practice section for the new bassist. If you go back and listen to the production of Metallica's other albums, the difference is obvious. As a matter of fact, I have a hard time listening to St. Anger using my headphones because the production is so bad.Don't get me wrong, I'll always consider myself a Metallica fan and I'll continue to support the band, but it's getting harder and harder with each album.
__label__1 So disappointing: I have loved all the author's other books and looked forward to reading this one; but what a disapointment. After reading these other reviews, I find I'm not alone. I'll look forward to his next release and hope he gets back on track.
__label__2 It works! I recommend it!: Nice black type. Box it shipped in was warn and I recommend that they purchase new boxes rather than re-use. I think the price could withstand the added cost. It just would give customers a more secure feeling that it will work for a long time. Packing materials were totally fine.
__label__2 Adorable.: This was the first Manga I picked up, I love it :) I've read it a few times in the short while I've had it. Even from the beginning, the characters are lovable (although, I might be a bit biased since I've watched most of the anime before buying the manga). However, at the beginning, the story has yet to really go anywhere. If you've seen the anime, you'll recognize a few of the events in here.There is some very mild nudity in this, but I can't see how this could offend anyone, if the female torso bothers you, you'll probably be bothered, but like everything, you draw your conclusions on it yourself, there isn't a label on it that says "Fan Service!", and I took it as a sort of insight in the innocence (or general airheadedness) of Chii.I highly recommend this, as well as the anime.
__label__1 Nothing more than a work of fiction!: Customers who purchased this book would also enjoy these fine works of fiction:Star WarsHarry PotterWilly Wonka and the Chocolate FactoryToy Story
__label__2 Current Prime Time Trash with a Kick: Acting, direction, dialogue and situations are enough to satisfy any prime time soap opera addict or enthusist. Several story lines going on at the same time without causing confusion. Bed and heart hopping are constant in this romp through Wisteria Street. Backstabbing, lying, rumors, lawlessness, controlling, and sex all seasoned with evil and vindictiveness.
__label__2 Richard Scarry's Best Big Storybook: I sent this book to my grandson for Christmas. My daughter was very happy to see it as she had one when she was little. It is a book to read to and share a nice few moments with your child or grandchild. Richard Scarry was always a favorite with my kids. His stories are funny and engaging for many ages. A great book.
__label__2 A Very Good Album: This album is the most maligned recording in the Black Sabbath catalog. Even Never Say Die (which is close to horrible) gets more respect in fan circles than Technical Ecstasy.I admit, this album marked the official end of the classic Black Sabbath era. The lyrics became less dark, and the band experimented musically, making more extensive use of keyboards. The band had experimented like this before, most notably on Sabbath, Bloody Sabbath (who can forget the synth song "Who Are You?"). On this album, they sound like they are definitely trying to get out of a rut. While the results clearly aren't up to the level of other Sabbath records like Master of Reality, this is still a very good album.Oddly enough, Technical Ecstasy makes more of a statement about where Ozzy's career would go as a solo artist than it does about Black Sabbath itself. The band would really deteriorate on the haphazard Never Say Die, which makes this the last really good Black Sabbath album with Ozzy Osbourne.
__label__1 Cheap construction: This item was so cheaply made that the supports for the game boards were of a crumbling, composite material - one piece was partially missing. The game arrived broken in pieces, but, I do not blame the seller for this, as it was obvious that it had not been well glued together.
__label__2 Just what I've been looking for: This is the scraper I've used and loved for years, but I can't find it in stores anymore. Heads and tails above plastic edges, especially for removing frost. As for complaints about bent blades - it's a scraper, not an ice pick. The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is the price.
__label__2 An eye opener, both for me and partner.: A very useful book, but it also emphasizes/idealizes the fact that these are one sided relationships, and that you are involved with a person who has an enormous difficulty becoming close with or identifying with others. It provided me with the clarity to see that at least the relationship I was in was not working, and that my partner would never realize my sacrifices in the name of "our" life, nor be in a position to reciprocate until she could trust me. The diservice this book does to the partner is it seems to downplay the frustration and rage that partners clearly expressed. This is an *extremely* difficult relationship to both be in and walk away from, and the author does not seem to address the anguish of the partner, only how the partner can stuff his/her feelings in the interest of helping the recovering partner get along. One fulfilled partner does not a relationship make, and a 5 year payoff is not guaranteed.
__label__1 disappointing and puzzling: I have to count myself among the other Coupland fans who were disappointed by this book. I've anxiously awaited everything Coupland's written since Generation X and was frustrated by the delay of this book (it was supposed to be out last fall). It was really not worth the long wait. Coupland's uncharacteristic descent into the Twilight Zone in the second half was interesting at first, but was so lamely concluded that it just left me wondering what he was thinking. I also found the characters pretty thin, and while I enjoyed the pop culture banter of the characters in his previous books, I was somewhat annoyed by it in this one, though I'm not sure why. This book just didn't reach me personally like his others have.I recommend that Coupland fans wait for paperback or hit the library for this one. I don't recommend it for non-fans.
__label__1 poor: this book turned out to be nothing of what i expected. i expected it to be a book of traps and various kinds of challenges in it, to give ideas to DM's who need a little help from time to time (as we all do). instead, what i got was a book that has four examples of particular challenges for various level of characters. i thought this limited the use of the book tremendously, and hence has been the book that i least spent time reading and using.
__label__1 Snooze away: ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ, oh, sorry I fell asleep there for a bit....Must have been trying to listen to the Good, the Bad and the Queen again......Actually the title track seemed to have some energy, but concidering the rest of the cd is lacking in any, it came as a welcome suprise.....Some review made reference to Blur's Modern Life is Rubbish...The only thing similar to that wonderful recording, is Damon's participation and the last word in the title.
__label__2 Deep Funky Jazz: I first heard this album when a friend of mine bought it at a yard sale. I was hooked right away and had to buy it. If you enjoy a more funky style jazz like Herbie Hancock almost then I definitely reccomend picking this album up.
__label__2 Julienne Potatoes: I am not a huge fan of convenience foods so prefer to cook from scratch when possible. But sometimes when you're on the go, it is helpful to have a few items that you can throw together at a moment's notice. Of all the pre-packaged potato mixes, I think this one is the best. My kids love these Julienne Potatoes.
__label__1 Lousy DVD from Disney: No problems with the film itself, I saw the theatrical release several years ago, and loved it. I refuse to buy the lame excuse for a DVD that Buena Vista has offered. When will the message get through? Serious films need the serious treatment on disc, especially if we are going to be gouged with Disney prices. The absence of anamorphic enhancement on this film is close to criminal in my eyes, and the rest of the shoddy package, right down to the boilerplate on the case, is an insult. Criterion did a Laser Disc of this film, and this DVD needs the Criterion treatment. Tell me I'm having a bad dream!!
__label__1 Liberal Dreck: Parts of the movie were fine. The Scenery was great and even the low tech monsters worked. The acting was fair to good. I could even get by the mixture of accents and contemporary slang.What killed the movie for me was the ridiculous and misplaced modern liberal hand wringing by the Polley character. The modern sentiments seemed completely out of place in 6th century Nordic Culture. A shame.
__label__1 A Disappointment - Let's get original.: Anybody cannot do a remake. They would have been better off with original material. It was a disappointment. Listening to the CD left you wanting to hear the original. I would not waste my money or time. Hopefully we can hear beautiful music from the duo in the future that is original and fresh with their own original touch. Chante is such a talent and Kenny is not bad so let's put your talent to work.
__label__1 Not an American made Tool: I wish that I had known that the hacksaw was not made in America(USA). There are so few items manufactured in America, anymore. I make it a practice to buy tools that are made in America. If a tool is imported, it should say so. I was very disappointed.
__label__2 Just what I needed!: This works perfect with my HP LaserJet Pro P1606dn Printer (CE749A#BGJ). It is long enough to reach without having a ton of cord hanging and getting in the way.
__label__2 Last Hours of Ancient Sunlight: This is an important book for everyone to read. We need to be informed as to our 'out of control' consumption of earth's resources and learn how to live so that those who come after us can live well too.
__label__2 Depends on the Cat?: This does what it is supposed to, but my cat is so lazy that he does not chase it around but simply rolls it enough for a treat to come out. If no treat comes out he will hit it against furniture or a wall. It's like watching a cat play with a ball in slow motion! Still I guess a little more motion is better than none!
__label__2 I love this!!!: Every year at the change of seasons, my cat gets dry, flakey, itchy skin. She chews off most of the fur at the base of her tail to help with scratching. Within 2 days of giving her this with her canned food, she was biting less, and the flakey skin was all but gone. We have just kept this up with her everyday feelings and it keeps the dryness away and her coat very shiny and soft. I have also recommended this to my friend, she got it for her dog, who is allergic to fleas, and she loves it as we'll!!
__label__2 Awesome!: Yes it's Rammstein at there best from a great show in France. I was a little surprised how many people in France know how to speak German and like Rammstein that much, but what the heck it's an awesome show. The France show has DTS and the sound is outstanding. Quality video with some goodies at the end from, Japan, Britain, and Russia shows plus some other Rammstein stuff. I am very happy to own this.
__label__1 Junk: I purchased this little heater for use in my office at work. (Our office is in a drafty old building, and during the winter, some additional heat is often needed). This unit is extremely loud, to the point that it is absolutely unusable in an office setting. I couldn't hear phone calls over its loud fan. It also turns itself off about every 5 minutes due to over heating, right from brand new if it's too close to another object. Not to mention that it stinks. Will be going right back.
__label__2 Insightful description of every relationship: Definitely a book that begs, "buy me as a gift". And I will, my best friends birthday is today and she will receive this book when next I see her. There are quotes worthy of posting throughout. My favorite? "If we can keep each other laughing, we can keep each other sane."
__label__1 Not the same size: The style is ok. The quality is poor. The left shoe is much narrower than the right one. Be careful! Don't waste your money.
__label__2 An excellent laboratory manual, and indispensable to any TA!: This is such a stupendous laboratory manual, it could almost substitute as a text for the course. Nybakken verbally walks students though the dissections and gives thorough coverage to both external and internal anatomy. For each phylum or group of phyla there are large, clear diagrams of dissections for a huge variety of animals local to the California coast. (There are diagrams for 14 different organisms in the Gastropod section alone, and cover almost all of the animals students could possibly see in lab.) The text also includes taxonomic information and discussions on animal diversity including habitat, external morphology, feeding, behavior, etc. Plus, it is well written, well organized and easy to read!
__label__1 Pretty dreary; only for the Garland completist....: This soap opera is not enlivened by the generally downbeat songs. Garland is a virtual parody of her more vigorous younger self. This is a camp spectacle, from the youthful drag performers in Gilbert and Sullivan to the jerky, hand-wringing Garland. This is the Garland that drag performers got down pat 40 years ago. The film is more artifact than entertainment. Only if you like studying Garland from beginning to end is this likely to be of interest.
__label__2 Nice but way overpriced: I have to agree with most of the other reviewers, this thing costs what a 16GB USB thumbdrive costs and I'm pretty sure it's basically the same thing inside. It's sad that you can't use standard USB devices as memory units but this thing does what it's supposed to...
__label__1 Occult?: This book basically suggests using Subliminal messaging for a way to read.In this book Paul Scheele suggests some of the books to subject your mind to by subliminal messages are occultic, such as 'Silva's Mind Control'.Silva's Mind Control teaches Transcendental Meditation, Paul says you do not need to read the book, but subject your self to it subliminally. There are many references to Zen and other mystical religions. For an example of what Silva's Mind Control will do to you, but the following book[ASIN:0890813221 The Beautiful Side of Evil]]. "The Beautiful Side of Evil"
__label__2 No wonder he is the guru: The book provides information on every aspect of the game, which comes from hands-on experiences in top level of playing and teaching. Unlike others, it has been well justified and makes a lot of sense. Get the book and follow what he says, which will definitely improve your game.
__label__2 Knowing It From A Summer's Day, Many Years Ago: *Dry Your Eyes*, the 1967 debut album from Philadelphia's Brenda & The Tabulations, is not the most stylistically innovative music of that brief period where the difficulties inherent in being the world's kindly manager appeared to be solving themselves and difficulties intrinsic to the US often evaporated instantaneously in a nimbus of "modernist" sentiment -- this is the sound of the period before the Detroit and Newark riots scarred civic sentiment, but in my estimation it is something like the distillation of the young working woman's attitudes towards life in the urban United States. Brenda Payton encapsulates the "ethos" of that era's clerk, teller, cashier or operator in love with the possibilities of the city: but if the romance seems a little expansive to the contemporary ear, perhaps it wasn't entirely a good idea to not heed such sentiments as these. A truly enduring cultural artifact.
__label__2 Nice addition to Game Cube Games: I purchased this for use with the Gamecube game PokemonXD:Gale of Darkness so that my brothers could upload their pokemon from the Gameboy Advanced games. It worked wonderfully and neither I nor my brothers had any problems with it. In fact, my brothers requested me to buy another one so they can play against each other in other Gamecube games as well!
__label__1 Rollins's reach exceeds his grasp in Ice Hunt: There's no shame in not understanding the details of modern naval telecommunications, or the aerodynamics of flight, or how flight control systems work on aircraft, or the physics of modern weapons, or small-unit military tactics. They're all complex subjects. But why would you showcase those details when you hadn't done the research to write about them in an authentic way? Why would his editor not get someone to review these technical details? I had to drop this book about 75% of the way through it because I couldn't take the inaccuracies any longer. What a disappointment!
__label__2 wish they'd had these years ago: I always recommend these wearable blankets to new parents. My oldest son is grown, and I wish they'd had these when he was a baby. No worrying about a blanket over the face!
__label__1 Help! This movie is a mess!: The only good thing about this movie are the Beatles themselves. The plot(and I'm being generous when I call it that ) is very weak and not funny. If everything else could be edited out except when the Beatles are either performing or on screen by themselves then we would have something watchable. It is way too scripted. The Beatles are at their best just being themselves as in a "Hard Days Night"
__label__2 Life changing: A truly great remote. This has changed my life. And my wife said we didn't need it; hah. I've started exercising and dieting. I buy my wife flowers every day.Seriously, very simple. I was able to configure it on my computer in 15 minutes with the set up program that came with it (via USB). I had settled in for a 2 hour setup. I use a 5.1 receiver, multidisk DVD player, TV with PIP that uses the tuner from a VCR, and set atop cable box. One simple push of a button and it turns the appropriate devices on and chooses which device controls volume, channel etc. The only negative is that now I need a better TV commensurate with the remote.
__label__1 Good for the hard of hearing.: I have had these for years. I put one next to me at my hearing level. Thus my husband can listen to TV more quietly. For me it is mostly for TV, some music, and occasional movies. It does cut out on some of the old movies -- in the quiet places. There may be better ones out there, but these work for me. Another thing I like is putting them in the kitchen and listening to the news while I am making dinner or doing dishes. It is much clearer then the TV speakers...
__label__2 A GREAT baby gift!: I have given this as a baby gift many times! Parents love this book! Children love this book! I highly recommend it for a great and original baby gift! The illustrations are great, and the rhythm of the book allows the child to memorize the words!
__label__2 Yes One of the Best: It's obvious that "Mitchell" was a copy of the Shaft movie and short-lived television series: his own man; rebel within law enforcement while sticking it to the man;sex machine (sort of); and willing to take changes regardless of the odds. BUT the cast of MST3000 rip it to shreds. With the exception of Gypsy (extremely annoying), the cast has some good one liners: "Mr Treveno has been hit again" ; "he just landed just short of the green"; "fresh panties all around"; and Tom Servo's obsession with Joe Don Baker's eating/farting. One of the best!!!
__label__1 Short - Too High?: The MAJOR problem with this processor is the fact that the blade (that does all the work) is completely useless, as it "spins" nearly a full inch above the bottom of the cup! Small batches cannot be blended.
__label__2 Definitely a cozy mystery.: And better than one or two of the previous Aunt Dimity booksthat I've read. I've seen this series described as "light asa feather," and I suppose that it is, but there is usuallyenough substance to hold my interest. I found a couple of thebooks to be almost too light, but Aunt Dimity Takes a Holidayreturns to a more entertaining level. There is more of amystery within the story, and Lori doesn't seem quite soinclined to fall into another man's arms. (Occasionally Iam more than a bit distracted by the heroine's inclinationsto find men other than her husband so terribly attractive. Alittle less of this would be welcome.)
__label__1 Correlle spoon Rest: Very nice appearance and function but not happy with deeply embedded darkened burned area from being next to burner. Fortunate this did not cause fire.
__label__2 We LOVE this book: This book is just fantastic. I am so sad that it's out of print! Not only are the stories touching and absolutely honest, there are some laugh out loud funny parts. My daughter quotes lines from the book from memory just so we can crack up together! Highly, highly recommended. Get your hands on a copy any way you can!
__label__1 harmful ingredients: Contains multiple types of parabens. I will not use harmful ingredients on my skin.Trading comfort for cancer is not an option.
__label__2 Shocking, upsetting, powerful.: Let me blunt; I direct hard core full on, bondage and s&m; porn for a living. There is very little that can upset me or get inside my skin and bother me for days and weeks afterwards...but this movie did it. I almost had to turn away while watching and I did have nightmares. I would also find myself staring off into the distance reliving the most disturbing parts in my mind.This is, without a doubt, a masterpiece. I doubt I will ever watch it again but a movie than create such emotion within the viewer deserves a good, honest review.
__label__2 Gooseflesh for the connoisseur: This is one of the movies where you get really frightened without actually knowing why. There is no gore (exept perhaps when the old doctor gets suffocated by tons of grain), but a lot of sinister images. Actually, if I hadn't read what the plot of the film is, I wouldn't have known, still, I felt very frightened by its whispering, shady, sinister images.
__label__1 Monitor blackout: I purchased this reconditioned monitor at Fry's with a three month warranty. After four months the monitor blacked out. After powering it off and back on, the picture stays for a few seconds before it blacks out again. Now I see a thread of 61 people having the same problem. Not a good product. Shame on you HP.
__label__2 Best breast milk storage bags: I experimented with several different bags before finding these to be the easiest to use and most secure. The double ziploc is reassuring and I find the bags easy to fill and pour. With this baby, we have found the bags to rip more frequently if we are careless and let two bags freeze together. Also as with all of the milk bags, don't go by the oz marking on the bag. measure in your pump containers then fill the bags.
__label__2 Good Book: I thought this book was pretty good, different but good. It gets kind of far-fetched at times, and drifts away from reality, but, for the most part it is a decent book to read.As usual, the author did not create any unique dialogue, but I've yet to find an author nowadays who can write any kind of half-decent dialogue.But, I would recommend this book to others to read.
__label__1 Hannity might as well have lived in Nazi Germany!!!!: This guy is the biggest right wing propoganda machine next to Fat Rush Limbaugh that I've ever seen. I think they made a mistake when they published this book, they accidently put the statue of liberty where the swaztica was supposed to go!May rating is actually -1000 stars
__label__2 Not bad: This was actually alot better than the previous one. I read it clear through. Its a good read. And educational too..
__label__2 great custmer relations: awsome series the first shipped to me was stolen in transit all i recv.was an empty evlope so i called and amazon sent a replacement right away ups and im a truck driver and only have limited time at home but i received it in time to take with me on the road thanks amazon you will have my continued buisness paul wells.P.S.great great show
__label__2 The Great 1's Review: This is simply a great book showing you step by step instructions on how to use hypnosis. This book comes with an hypnosis wheel and sample hypnosis scripts. I would recommend this book to anyone thinking about trying hypnosis. Some sections of this book go to far into detail (making the book boring).
__label__1 Not a good product: I've bought mine for about one year. But I just used it for three times. The food cooked were very hard and dry. Taste quite bad. I don't understand why so many people still recommend it.
__label__1 Ughhh: Peice of crap.No play lists, impossible to update unless you want a hassle. No good software that is out of date and unsupported by the company. Withing 4 days of barley using it it froze on me then shut off and became a brick. Dead. Looked on several forum for advice and no help, went to old forum threads and found out how to turn it back on and another way to update. Bricked again. Now nothing works.Oh by the way, the advice i followed for updating another way was on their official site by an official staff member with the company.HA.I will not reccomend this to anyone nor buy again.ProSoundSizeBatteryLooksConsEverything else.
__label__1 Stopped working after 4 hours of use: I bought this to replace the DVD player my kids use in the car. They watched a movie at home and it worked great. We were ALL excited it had two sets of headphones. They used it in the car to watch one movie and it worked fine. Then they went to watch another movie and it stopped playing about 10 minutes into the movie. The screen just froze and nothing would work. We changed DVDs and it gave an error message of "Wrong disc". We tried disc after disc and it never worked again. I was going to get the same player again, b/c I really liked it, but upone further reflection, I think I won't buy this one again.
__label__2 Great For Model Railroading: I'm using it to glue foam roadbed to Styrofoam and it works great. I only put the glue on the roadbed and it's holding great.
__label__2 An entralling first book for the Belgariad series.: This series definately ranks amoung my top five for the all time greats. Pawn of Prophecy is an excellent book but it doesn't make you wonder very much. For example Garion heard about the mysterious sorceress Polgara and his aunt's name is Pol. Figure it out. Little things like that don't leave much to the imagination . This is an excellent book though and I'd definately recommend it to readers who like fantasy. It is easy to read and is quite hard to put down. Give it a try.
__label__1 Too Loud: I recently had to replace my Peaceful Planet Aquarium with the Ocean Wonders Aquarium. I am not pleased with the Ocean Wonders, it is obnoxiously loud, there is nothing "peaceful" or "aquatic" about the aquarium. Needless to say I am returning the Ocean Wonders and purchasing another Peaceful Planet off of Ebay.
__label__1 7001 Resumes: This is one of the worst resume books I have ever seen! It is poorly written, formatted atrociously, resume examples are awful (and there are no where near 7,0001 examples). Don't waste your money! I'm sorry that there are no options to give this a minus star rating.
__label__1 Not good: This play has poor acting. It features Fantasia Barrino (American Idol winner) and Faith Evans (R&B Singer). The two top stars only have cameo appearances and sing one song each. The remainder of the movie centers around the Gay club owner whose acting skills are not that great. The whole play was overdone as far as the acting was concerned and could have been done in alot better taste. Basically the whole play just drags on until you finally get to end which is horrible also.
__label__1 Very Sad that this Version is Edited: I have to say that I am very sad hearing that this new release to Blu-Ray is Edited and the song "When Love is Gone" is still missing. I am very Thankful that I have the Widescreen Complete Version from Laser Disc to watch every year. What I don't understand is why Disney chose to edit this movie? It's a Great movie with the full version that the Henson's made so many years ago. Make it right and then maybe I will buy it. No thanks, Disney keep your edited version. Very sad :(
__label__2 Kix are for Kids!: Being and avid Kix fan since 1983 with the release of the first album I must say that this CD is one of my all time favorates. Steve sounds the same via Live or Studio. A sign of a true vocalist. Listening to this CD brings back fawn memories of the good old days of Kix shows in Hagerstown MD. Recently seeing his latest project Funny Money, Steve can still "Kix" the heart and soul with live performances just like he does on this CD.
__label__1 30" Barstool - Box shows 29": The barstools I ordered are to be 30" high. The boxes that these came in are labeled as 29".I haven't yet opened the boxes as I'm contemplating sending them back.
__label__2 Compliment after compliment: I wear these shoes with everything. They are stylish enough to be worn out for the night as well as dress down enough to be worn with jeans. Very comfortable, holds true to the Clark brand. I would size down because I normally wear a 13 and it swallowed my feet, had to return for a 12
__label__2 It summarizes lot of good technical informations: Even though it didn't cover enough info for CCNA, it explains extremely well. Easy understanding. A book you must keep.
__label__2 More Evidence Proving They Were Groovilicious: If you're a Style Council fan you must own this album. Phony musicians stink when recorded live but The Style Council sounded even better live than in the studio ("Home and Abroad" is also a necessity). This disc spans several years and features covers of some soul gems along with their own songs. They groove so hard on One Nation Under a Groove, Meeting (Over) Up Yonder and Hanging On To A Memory to justify the cost. The only downers are some snippets of Mick Talbot singing lead (oy vey) and a couple mediocre tracks, but those are minor trifles with this gem for us Council fans.
__label__1 Amazon's Rating: Another product in a list that were ordered but were not received on time. The stars are not for the products. They are for amazon's service!
__label__2 I LOVE this book!: i first came across cup of clay while doing a book report for my ninth grade class, and was stunned when the story knocked me off my feet. i dug through a million layers of sellers to get the second book, and have written letters to carole nelson douglas begging her to write the third. ms. douglas, if you're reading this - BLACKMAIL YOUR PUBLISHERS! finish the story!
__label__1 Slow suicide on film: Slow, irrelevant, depressing. I can't believe i even spent 2.99 and wasted an evening. A wasted life that left a trail of pain.
__label__1 It was ok, nothing special: I guess I had too high of hopes reading hunter thompson. The short stories are ok, but nothing compared to his other works. Move on to the next hunter book if you are getting into his work.
__label__2 Big Work by Young Author: Wow....I am so in love with this book !! Once I started to read it, I couldn't put it down. The suspense and mystique grabbed a hold of me, and just wouldn't let me go until I got to the end. My favorite part was.....Well, you'll just have to read it....I'm not giving anything away.
__label__2 the ventures rock and roll forever: just saw the ventures in new york at the bbking blues cafe still playing great after 50 years keep rockin
__label__2 Great Album: 3.5/5Chicago native Rhymefest made a very good album with his debut, Blue Collar. Rhymefest displays a variety of emotions on this album, transitioning skillfully from heavy to light subject matter at times. Fest's creative story-writing and telling abilities along with his unique flow are omnipresent throughout the whole album, making it a great listen. Standout tracks include the conscientious "All I Do," the brash street single "Chicago-Rillas," the braggadocio "Dynomite" song (although the original version was much better), and "More," a song with a valuable message that features Kanye West on the hook.
__label__1 Good movie bad game...: The movie included with this pack is an excellent action flick that will show of your home theatre system nicely. It isn't a movie that should be criticized on plot, etc. because in the end it wasnt going for an oscar award and simply trying to be a good action movie which it is. the special effects are very well done and the sound is also above average. Where this movie really shines is the picture quality. The widescreen edition's picture quality is perfect. i cant imagine how good the pan and scan version looks. However this pack does have its down side. and that is the poor quality of the video game of The Mummy Returns. Lets face it there arent that many good video games out there made after movies (exceptions being Goldeneye N64, possibly The World is not Enough N64). So in the end the high price on this pack probably isnt worth it, you should just get the DVD alone and save yourself the money
__label__2 Best so far!: i think that moby's newest single, 'Southside', the 7th song on the album, 'Play' is one of the best released so far. the way he can express emotions and feelings through his music is just amazing to me..., the vocals and instruments on the song truly excell to the top. overall a brilliant masterpiece from moby again! he also show good taste by having Gwen Stefani be the featured vocalist.
__label__1 Review From a Future Critic: This book uses a used plot. So you know the story already, which is a disappointment if you were expecing something new.But nevertheless, it's a good book because it's about the Justice League, specificcally the Martian Manhunter (one of my two favorites: Martian Manhunter and Green Lantern)who has the powers of Martian Strength, Martian Vision (similar to Superman's heat vision), Telepathy (the ability to read minds), The power to phase (pass through solid objects) and morph (change his body to disguise himself as anyone or even a monster) If your a collector like I am it doesn't mean that you can get by without this book just because it's old material, though.

__label__1 Terrible Battery: Will not hold a charge and will not charge half the time. Spend the extra cash and get a REAL battery.
__label__2 Awesome!: I love this book! I read the first one (Passion Marks I) and thought it was great, but this one is actually even better. I look forward to reading other novels by this author...he is an amazing writer!
__label__2 Defining Album: They can't live up to this and thank God, for that. This album is a hallmark of an age. An age of metal, that will come in about 5 to 10 years. People will look back on this album and realize that this was the first of a new generation, and that it has been vastly under apprectiated. First of all, the Bass... Ryan Martinie is flawless... The bass actually serves a purpose in the songs... not just a walking backdrop. It acts as a second guitar, the way its supposed to be. Chad Gray, has written obviously superb lyrics, and he underscores his singing with some dramatic off center screaming. Every thing on this album serves a purpose. It is efficient and direct. If you listen closely enough you'll start to hear things that you never heard before either. Especially in the bass section. Don't let people fool you. Listen for yourself and decide. This is truly a masterpiece before its time.
__label__2 So good it hurts: 1979... I'm sitting in a partial differential equations class... some guy sitting next to me is so out of it, he's listening to a tape on his walkman. I ask for a listen. I put on the earphones and OH MY GOD WHAT IS THIS BEAUTIFUL SOUND? WHERE DID IT COME FROM?! It was Native Dancer, and though it took me some time to buy a copy for myself, the piercing clarity of Milton Nascimento's voice and Wayne Shorter's sax never faded from my memory. Now of course I've listened to these 10 tracks hundreds of times but I'm still just as fascinated. This is a masterpiece, a rare and electrifying summit of Brazilian pop with American jazz that somehow -- and god knows this dosn't happen very often -- makes both of them more focused and brilliant.
__label__2 Breathtaking!: I was attracted to the movie by my wife who is a big polar bear memorabillia collector. Though it's only an hour in length, it's scenic beauty will blow you away. Can you imagine what it looks like on an IMAX movie screen? WOW!
__label__2 Great Product: This is a fantastic device. I purchased one for myself, then for my daughter, and now for my salesmen. I highly recommend it to anyone who travels.
__label__1 Save your money!!!!: I have only owned one product(APD10US)from Targus and I will not buy another adapter product from them. I had this unit approximately 6 months and rarely used it when it quit working. At the time, my battery was shot (the reason I needed an Auto/Air adapter in the first place) and I lost my complete spreadsheet that I had been working on while flying back from Las Vegas. After this happened, I was so frustrated that I decided not to go through the hassle of getting a replacement. No more cheap adapters for me. After doing extensive research the second time around, I bought a LIND(3 year warranty)instead back in March of last year and it has worked just fine (with lots of usage). Mainly accessing the internet through WiFi hotspots using my wireless card on my notebook. Compare the warranties on each company before you buy. I hope this information will help you make the right decision the first time.
__label__2 my dream bike: my mom wouldnt get me one this christmas but im getting one hopefuly from my dad. the color is yellow , the speed is 18 mph , the max weight is 180 pounds . i think that this toy is cool because my freind in n.j has it and i rode it before.my brother likes it too & hes 19 yrs. old .!!!!!!!!
__label__1 >> Clinton Needs Much Help >>: Bad Title, Poorly edited and much too long (over 970pgs) for the content.The central attraction-Lewinski- seems a new/improved story.Publisher should not promote this as "Clinton comes clean" Mr President should've came clean UNDER OATH, in 98!I dont think this is a Tell all, as much as its a -Sell new.Theres good points but too few, the Foreign Affairs make great reading. And his Arkansas experiences give insight into the boy who would someday take the worlds most powerful office.The story about therapy/counsel offers relief to readers who find themselves worried for the man. I also wish President and Mrs Clinton would find the peace that good Christian living offers. Koodos to Hillary Rodam-Clinton for her strong position , as Solomon once said " A Good wife, is better than riches.
__label__2 Clothes dryer thermofuse: The transaction went perfectly well. The description and pictorial clarified that it was indeed the part I needed. Shipment was expedient and arrived quickly.
__label__1 OK: This book is for young children. I thought it had to do with animation but was disappointed. They should take to word animation out of the title. Yes the goggly eyes move, I guess that is what they mean for animation.
__label__1 not quite perfect: gasket broken when it arrived. I was lucky that I had a spare in my garage. casting is poor (holes weren't exactly the same size) this was a bit disappointing. Purchased to replace this part on 87 chevy pickup to eliminate exhaust leak. I hope this works. New design in that it has what may be known as "heat expansion cuts" weird but we'll see if they work. old models are one solid piece of metal--this has notches, very weird to look if you're old school.*UPDATE* 12/11/2012Returned manifold to Amazon. Do an internet search before buying this manifold. I ran across several poor reviews regarding this manifold. Did not fix exhaust leak. Not sure if even when brand new one is supposed to take this piece to be machined. My understanding is that the solid piece should be straight across--there were gaps at least 1/8th of an inch. Poor craftsmanship.
__label__1 doesnt fit all crossbows with scope attched: description says it fits most crossbows with a scope attached. i have a barnett DOA and it does not fit with a scope attached. tried several of my friends crossbows and they too did not fit with a scope attached.
__label__2 4 for 2: Asia's most popular work, and some of their best came on their first three cds, ASIA ( 5 stars), ALPHA (4), and ASTRA (3). They then released a best of cd, THEN AND NOW (3 1/2 stars), with 4 new songs. This new double disk combines all the songs from those 4 cds, onto 2 cds, plus 3 unreleased songs from that era. A better deal than buying all 4 cds seperate, and a lot more complete than THRN AND NOW. But their best deal is their Greatest Hits cd released last year, THE VERY BEST OF ASIA; HEAT OF THE MOMENT (1982-1990). Worth the money, and the remastering sounds great.
__label__2 good: toner cartridge came well packaged and installed perfectly. it took a couple of times for the printer to accept it, but all is working perfectly
__label__2 Begin to move: This book is very simple, if you are new and want to know how powerful the prayers can be, this is the one!You will begin to understand the real power of the Blood!
__label__1 Lots of puzzles but poor editing: I am hooked on Sudoku and it takes my spare time even if only a couple of minutes. Which is why I rely on the categories, I usually expect Easy to only take me a couple of minutes; even with medium I don't need to take notes. Unfortunately that is not the case with this set of puzzles. In fact, the very first one in the Easy category wasn't that 'easy'. But then some of the hard ones are actually easy.There are a lot to do and it will be fun. If not for the poor editing I would have rated it 5 stars.
__label__1 THIS IS SICK!: THIS BOOK IS CERTAINLY NOT WHAT ANY CHILD SHOULD BE READING! I WAS SHOCKED TO SEE SOME OF THE THINGS WRITTEN IN A KIDS BOOK. I HAVE COMPLAINED TO MY CHILD'S SCHOOL ABOUT THIS AND I PRAY THAT PARENTS WILL LOOK AT THIS BEFORE THEY LET THEIR CHILD READ IT! CHILDREN DO NOT NEED TO READ IN DETAIL HOW JONAS' FATHER KILLED A BABY. THIS IS NOT ENTERTAINING! WE WORRY SO MUCH ABOUT VIOLENCE AND TRASH AND THEN WE GIVE THIS BOOK TO OUR KIDS TO READ FOR A GRADE! IF YOU THINK THIS BOOK IS GOOD, I FEEL SORRY FOR YOU. MAYBE YOU SHOULD EXAMINE YOURSELF. HOW COULD THIS HAVE WON AN NEWBERY AWARD! PLEASE, IF THERE ARE CHILDREN'S AUTHORS READING THIS, P L E A S E! WRITE SOME HAPPY AND ENCOURAGING STORIES FOR OUR KIDS TO READ AND ENJOY!
__label__2 Good game, keeps true to the original Twisted Metal: It has a very similar feel of the original twisted metal. Many old characters are back and a few new ones make this game very amusing.
__label__1 LAME!: Sorry, but what happened to this author??? She used to be witty and interesting. Now she has gotten so lame. The contrived humor, the one-note characters, the gimmicky plot devices. I used to love her work but the last two books have been real stinkers! Also the stuff with Min's mother reminding her about her weight kept falling flat because these weren't remotely well-crafted or nuanced interactions. Instead, Crusie keeps beating us over the head with what we're supposed to find funny. I wish someone would tell this author to stop trying so maybe her books would feel natural again.
__label__2 A swinging good time.........: Excellent top notch arrangements with a swinging band. Great dance tempos and mix of original and covers. Everyone should check this band out, since they are out and about all over the place. I even picked up there Christmas CD to find some more beautiful arrangements. A six piece ensemble with one HUGE sound.
__label__1 Rudie from San Antonio: It's the same old Pop-Punk that's become extremely popular as of late. The songs sound just the same as anyother band of their type. But I have seen them live and it has made me hate this more then anything else for every single song they donated it "to the girls" and I can never forgive them for sitting thru that hour long set of hell.
__label__1 What a mess.....: This items works ok, if you like soft boiled eggs. The problem is the heating plate of the machine. It is simply not deep enough to deal with the water amount needed for hard boiled eggs. We have hot water on the counter everytime we cook hard boilded eggs with. Another short coming is the short handles on the lid. You have to be extremely careful to open the machine or you will scald yourself on the escaping steam. I've dealed with this hot water on counter problem for over one year and finally had it. I've purched the Krups machine (no problem here) and tossed this one. Think twice before bying. BTW this machine used to be called Salton until Toastmaster purchesed the company. Same product differenct company name.
__label__1 NO voice recorder! again NO voice recorder: i bought this for the voice recorder.but it doesn't HAVE a voice recorder.you just can trust anybody these days.everything i buy from COBY is junk.
__label__1 Too much fluff, not enough substance...: This book jumps all over the place and the authors love to stick in references to pop culture which are irrelevant. Most of their stories have nothing to do with kids at all. I was very disappointed in this poorly written book. I tried very hard, but could only read 2 pages at a time b/c I didn't know where the thought process was going. I enjoy reading Christian childrearing books, but this one did not keep my interest. I do however recommend an older book, but still great for parents with kids 5+. It is Gary Smalley's The Key to Your Child's Heart. Great advice in there(other than advocating spanking which I don't personally agree with--hey I'd rather have God upset with me for not hitting my kids than have him upset with me for hitting my kids)and an easy read.
__label__2 Audio paradise: I don't recall ever hearing more beautiful acoustic guitar picking than on the title track. Wonderful, revealing new versions of his most beautiful songs. I found the new renditions moving and eye-opening, particularly on Souvenirs and Six O'Clock News, but they're all gems. An essential addition to any John Prine collection.
__label__1 Not Impressed!: This was my first digital camera and I am not impressed with it. It drains batteries within 1-2 hours of use, there is a large delay in everything and my camera dosen't ever turn on anymore. It does take beautiful pictures, though I have to admit. My advice is buy a Canon, Nikon or Kodak camera instead of any Olympus.
__label__1 Bad idea: I agree! These pads are too thick, look ridiculous under your shirt, and are not comfortable. These pads are not worth the buy! I will recommend Lanisoh to anyone!! They are soft, comfortable, the perfect size for ANY absorbency, and DO NOT leave fuzzies on you (like a few others I have tried)!
__label__1 Cornwell has gotten all too predictable.: This book has convinced me to give up on Patricia Cornwell altogether. I loved her first two books, but the books after that have fallen into a predictable pattern and no longer interest me at all. What I most dislike about these books (and, unfortunately, this goes back to her earlier ones also--even though it didn't bother me as much then) is the way the female sleuth ALWAYS gets into danger herself toward the end of the book. I find this problem with most mystery or thriller writers who use a female lead character. Why is it that a woman problem solver cannot crack a case without putting herself in mortal fear? No more Cornwell for me
__label__1 Pretty, but boring: This game is fun to look at, with several actual clips from the show and some nice graphics. But there's precious little exciting about it. You have to wait up to a minute for every section of the game to download, which is a huge drag. And even though you are able to fine-tune your relationships with the other players it makes little difference in the tribal council voting -- characters that you are supposed to have an alliance with will vote you off anyway. Plus, for some reason my cursor doesn't work during the survival and challenge periods, which makes it sort of difficult to play. But these aspects of the game are boring anyway, and the challenges are similar to simple kiddy video games. Buy this game only if you are dying of curiosity.
__label__2 BANGIN BEATS: This album was a great contribution to the current state of music. Aaliyah's music was never one to be in the normalcy but she really blew us away with this album. She showed us her womanly attitudes and she shared her sexiness with us in a real classy way. I like this album and will keep it in the stereo for a while.
__label__1 Not What I Expected: Like most others commenting here, I thought this was the 1984 German film of the actual conference. It isn't. It's a very general documentary about the Jewish situation in Europe during the time leading up to the conference and while I enjoy a good documentary, this one is too general for my tastes. I have virtually all of the information here in other formats, making this redundant. Pity.
__label__2 Great!!!: Love this show! It's also great that it includes blue-ray, DVD, and ultraviolet options! The purchase arrived ahead of schedule and in great condition.
__label__2 Read Parts 1 & 2 together for maximum effect: Kay is a great writer. When I finished part 2 (I read the combined edition) there was a tear in my eye - exactly what happened the last time I read one of his works. I read quite a bit of sci-fantasy and to me Kay is the best writer in the genre.Unlike many who simply combine an ability to plot with some magic effects, Kay actually thinks - or his characters do, and they feel as well. I become involved with them and in the end I care about the outcome.You might want to start this pair of books by reading Yeats poem "Sailing to Byzantium" as it seems to be the basis for the vision of the book. Then too there is a Felini movie which ends with the characters becoming mosaics in a ruined villa...just the image relates I doubt the film does.Enjoy.
__label__2 Great Book: I love this book, it was exciting and fun. My co-workers recommeded this book and at first I was skeptical. In the end I was very happy. I read all of her books in three months. I feel that once you pick them up you can't put them down.
__label__2 A film that focus on who Jeffrey Dahmer was as a man: It's no doubt that actor Jeremy Renner made this movie watchable. His performance is incredibly strong as the serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer. He managed to show a guy who really had two completely different lives. The scariness of the film is that serial killers could be among us and we would never know. Of course we wouldn't. Dahmer managed to live a regular life just like the rest of us, but was moonlighting as a vicious killer who managed to side step the authorities. The films focus is on the duality of his life and is more a humanistic story rather than a sensational horror flick. It's clear this is an independent low budget film so you have to cut it some slack that not enough was done with it. The performances are all eerily powerful enough that you don't need much else anyway.
__label__2 Very good: Great read it was hard to put down just like all of her books I can't wait to see what's next
__label__2 charlie's view: i agree with the other reviews. i also think that he is an incredible guitarist. although this record has phenomenol guitar playing, it does lack something. but i will say this. the follow up Mind Over Matter is not only much better, but in my opinion right up there with Yngwie's first solo CD as one of the best guitar albums of all time. If you want to hear Bellas at his best(so far) you should really pick up Mind Over Matter or his CD with John West(Mind Journey)...
__label__1 Cheap was more expensive: Bought this power supply for my research lab. Very cheap as compared to equivalent, established brands. After 6 month, and very little use with moderate load, it short circuited internally. Manufacture warranty had just expired. No reasonable repair possible, just recycle. Beware, sometimes cheap is more expensive.
__label__2 Works well!: I have owned this heater for a couple of months and am very happy with it. It has been a very cold winter and it helps me keep my oil consumption down by using it where I sit to watch tv or use the computer. I would recommend it and was very happy with the price on Amazon.
__label__2 Couldn't ask for more: We received the book within just a couple days of placing the order and it was just as described "like new". I don't think the pages had ever been turned.THANK YOU!!!!!
__label__2 Yowza!: Very lively and stirring arrangements, using appropriate forces. You will never hear the like of Little Drummer Boy arranged as Ravel's Bolero--some benighted people dislike either or both--which is truly creative. Played this disk twice through on super-audiophile system once while writing my cards and once in listening chair and could not hear anything but joy. Much improved over his other Xmas effort and the John Williams Joy to the World misfire..
__label__1 Very well written but extremely biased in view: I have read many books about the Crusades and "Holy War" is by far the most biased book I have read about them. Karen Armstrong is an apologist for the Islamic world. The Islamic expansionary wars under the Umayyad caliphate of the 7th and 8th centuries are viewed with respect and understanding whereas the crusades to retake these once Christian lands are seen as atrocious. I realize that mostly Westerners will be reading this book, and perhaps that is why she goes out of her way to "side" with the Muslims, to try and make us understand their viewpoint. But she goes too far with this, not only by discrediting crusading achievements but by leaving out essential facts that would threaten to tarnish the Muslim image she has created.
__label__2 Loved it.: Dead is Dead. What a wonderful idea, the whole concept of this Torchwood (I have happily seen them all). I found myself thinking about it at work, during the day. Genius.
__label__2 My health and weight-loss answer!: I have lost 30 lbs. and feel healthier and more alive than ever. I thought it would be very hard to give up processed foods and live on real, unprocessed, whole foods; but, it has not been. I will always enjoy an occasional unhealthy food; but, this program is my new way of life. It's not a diet. It's a new way to live in optimum health!
__label__2 THIS BOOK IS VERY REALISTIC!: Like I said this book is good. It helps teenagers cope with problems they may be having. A lot of kids think they're the only ones who could have problems and if they tell someone, they'll end up getting hurt. But that's not true. People want to help you. You just have to find someone you trust like the charcters in this great book. I recommend this book to anyone who likes action. And by the way this is the best book I've read yet !!
__label__1 Horrible low budget stinker: This straight to dvd movie is about as low budget as it gets. At first I thought one of the supporting characters had killed her off. Then the movie moves ahead like it never happened. Most of the special effects look very fake and cheaply made. They are so fake it ruins the hint of gore I was expecting. The main character actress does a fare job but this about the only redeeming quality in this hole movie.
__label__2 Interior Design and Decoration Review: This book is a required textbook for my interior design classes. I believe it will be a useful resource for years to come.
__label__1 Good Voice, Bad Music: I brought this album in hopes in finding another Sarah Brightman, a cross-over opera singer with a strong and beautiful voice. There is no doubt that Emma Shapplin can't sing, it is just that the music is blan and uncaptivating. Every song sounds like the other, and all of the songs are dull, no gems on this one. Her voice sometimes seems not to be flowing with the music, and it seems as if she is being held back from really displaying her talent. The music also doesn't flow, and it seems as if the musicians can't decide what tune to play next. The whole album is substanceless and the songs aimless. Still, I have just purchased her other ablum, because believe she has the talent to create an album as good as Sarah Brightman's, so I've given her a second chance. However, I certainly wouldn't buy this one again, even if I do like the other.
__label__1 Don't try this in public!: I can only give 1 star for the idea behind the book, but the author should have consulted a wider range of people to get to know the typical "German slang". Words like "abasten" or "abflottieren" really don't exist in the actual German language. If you want to know about German slang, buy a book like "Kauderwelsch: American Slang, das Andere Englisch" from Annette Linnemann and Renate Georgi-Walsk, where you can see the German expression for American slang, too. Or just ask the people around you in Germany, they will help you for sure. But don't buy this book, it's really not worth it.
__label__2 Great product!!!: I live out in the sticks and I get crystal clear service now with this... Easy to setup, anyone can do it with the easy instructions... Supper fast shipping... I will buy another one for work...
__label__2 this album is one of my favourites: This album is definitely one of the best albums i own. Diana is one of the worlds best artists, and this album is the work of a genius from an artist with one of the best sounding voices ever. Some of the songs on this album totally rock and you will fall in love with them straight away. Others take a while to grow on you, but they eventually will, and then you will find yourself with album full of favoutites. This album is slighty different to her other album beatiful obscene, but if you like that album you will love this album. Beautiful Obscene can be found on this website, but you will have to search under the name Diana Anaid, as it seems Diana has changed the spelling of her name, and you can actually listen to samples of beautiful obscene, its just a pity people cant listen to samles of this album before they buy it. Just like ZEMONSTER says, GET THIS RIGHT AWAY along with Beautiful Obscene, as you wont be able to stop listening to them.
__label__1 Too Christian: I found this difficult to read because of the constant Christian references. I was looking to read a light romance, but the pronounced Christian views kept pulling me out of the story. For a person not of Christian faith I would not recommend this book.
__label__1 Not Impressed: I'm real quick with my reviews: First ten to fifteen minutes, Oh, I'm juiced! Then, NOT SCARY! PRE -'oh so'- DICTABLE! The ending left me saying, literally, "What the Fuh...? My God, how stupid! Was that supposed to be scary?!? Did my DVD skip a chapter? Why can't ANYONE make a scary movie anymore?"
__label__1 Very Interesting: York writes an interesting book and a worthwhile read if you are into the whole battle of the 'left' vs. the 'right'. York believes that the left will continue to get stronger in the future as it plots to take down the right. If York believes that the right is winning in spite of some vast left-wing conspiracy however, he is simply flattering his target audience. Overall I would recommend this to someone who is a strong Republican supporter but all others will probably be disappointed.
__label__2 Easy and thoroughly enjoyable read: I picked up this book while working our school library's Scholastic Book Sale fundraiser. I was looking for something I could pick up and put down in between customers. Unfortunately, I couldn't put the book down. I am not a good reader, usually lean towards books with short chapters and rarely finish any book. I finished this book so quickly I was shocked and sad when the last chapter came to an end.I am not an educator but I am a parent of a very intellectual 3rd grader. He has a male teacher this year for the first time and I read a few passages from your book. He laughed so hard his mouth hurt. I thanked Mr. Done for giving parents a peek-a-boo view into the lives of our kids and the teachers who spend their days with them.It was thoroughly entertaining and enlightening.
__label__2 In-depth Perspective of The NYPD: Mr. Silverman does a wonderful job here. The author makes a very complicated subject easy to understand and read. Silverman brings you right into the workings of the NYPD. The breakdown of the strategies that the NYPD implemented to combat crime was remarkable. Silverman explains Compstat so that the reader can fully understand its meaning and usefulness. This book was not written just for the police world but, for the communities that they serve. If you want to see how the real boys in blue catch the bad guys this book is a must.
__label__2 Too easy!: After using a overlarge hip pack for a couple of years, it was time to invest in a real Man Bag. Read the other reviews here re: this item and for the price I figured I could not go wrong. It's been two weeks now and it's great. Maybe just a wee bit too big but I'm sure I'll fill it in time. No issues with the zippers or any smells (as per another review).Lot's of space. 4 zippered compartments, 1 open compartment. A spot for my business card holder. Also a place to clip my keys. Not a shoulder strap kind of guy so no comment on it. Does the trick and the price was quite fair. Thanks!
__label__1 200 'tablets': I ordered this online as the price was definitely cost effective compared to buying it in the local grocery store. Many were broken within the bottle, and every one that I took from the bottle and put into a weekly dispenser disintegrated completely. I would definitely avoid buying these again and look for something with a protective coating.
__label__1 Boring: This is the worst Steven Seagal movie ever. Story has been done before, create a super human soldier, and better. Looks like post production dubbed over Steven Seagal's voice numerous times.
__label__1 Seam came unraveled: I would have given these a great review except for the fact that a leg seam came unraveled after 3 washings. They run small so size up one size. They don't ride up. They don't roll at the legs. They are invisible under pants and they are comfortable. It's a shame they aren't made better. For the price I expected to have them around a bit longer than 2 months.
__label__1 Jay-Z worse than disco: Unbelievable. I love Linkin Park and then they produce this trash. Jay-Z...who buys this stuff. I actually tried listening to his stuff, Can you say monotonous and boring. I cannot suggest purchasing this CD.
__label__2 Great for stressed adults, too!: I love the smell of lavender, and had recently spent over $30 on a lavender/honey body mist to spray on before bedtime to help me unwind for the day (a tiny bottle). I actually saw this Johnsons product at Rite-Aid and bought it there. Not only does it smell great, but I fell asleep very quickly... the smell is extremely soothing and light. It also lasts for several hours. My new favorite nighttime/after bath lotion!! For $5, it can't be beat.
__label__2 A triumph of the imagination: Francois Schuiten is one of the most accomplished artists working in the field.This handsome trade paperback reunites three graphic novels that comprise the Hollow Grounds cycle.Worth mention is the excellent arguments by his brother Luc.CARAPACES - Actually a collection of six stories that displays Schuiten's versatility, experimenting with a series of techniques.ZARA - Zara is a vertical planet inhabited entirely by woman that never experimented "conventional" sex with men.After the arrivalof invaders with "vines" below their waists, things take a bizarre and often amusing turn.Zara is a marvelous blend of satire, adventure and science fiction that should appeal for fans of trippy european comics.NOGEGON - Another baroque, amazing and wild adventure.This time a character from Zara goes in search of a missing friend andbecomes embroiled in a plot involving symmetry and murder.
__label__1 Great Idea, but not so good design: The idea behind this is great :-) but the functionality is terrible. We used this to go tubing down a calm river and it was constantly filling with water. It's also very small and doesn't hold much at all. If you put too much weight in it, it takes on even more water. It's not really insulated and the ice melts rather quickly. i would love to see this re engineered a little larger, more insulated and somehow able to stay afloat without taking on water. until then ... save your money!
__label__1 Same old, same old: A repetition of virtually every other "think and it shall come to you" book on the market, and not very well done. The author has an unfortunate stream-of-consciousness approach to writing this book. Instead of taking things a step at a time, he jumps around like a monkey in the trees. Don't bother buying - check it out from the library.
__label__1 the world is full of consumer morons!!!!!!!: I have purchased 2 S-50's, 2 other Sirius radios complete with home kits and been given 1 by friends who were done with Sirius. I now have to listen to sirius radio on the internet through my computer. All their radios are pieces of junk, designed to breakdown, so you can purchase more of them. I have refused to play this game anymore. I just wish there was a reputable company out there that would produce a decent product. i also understand if they did that they would be out of business because no one would need to buy their product again. Unfortunately the only one who is going to change this is YOU the Consumer. You stop purchasing these pieces of crap and they will have to put quality back in their product to stay in business.We are all guilty of this, I refuse to play this game anymore.
__label__1 Disappointed: Did not performed as specified. When aux unit played AAIGM24 would repeatedly pause and restart. Merchant was prompt with refund; no questions asked.
__label__2 All About Money: Exxon Mobil, Haliburton, Dick Cheney et. al., still destroying America. Recently, 3 major university studies attempting to prove fracking was not harmful have been discredited. This film fulfills it's main purpose in all respects, primarily raising awareness to the dangers to human life, animal life and the planet due to fracking. And, it's all about money. Excellent film exposing the failure of departments of environmental quality and even some congressmen. So, what's new? I saw it, now I'll buy it and make sure all my grandkids see it.
__label__2 Great buy, great exercise bike.: I love this exercise bike. Very easy to use, operates very smoothly, and is quiet. I have bought at least 3 otheritems to exercise on, and hated them all. This is the best. No impact on my joints.
__label__1 VIDEO NOISE PROBLEM!!!: After trying TWO separate SD700's, I am returning them both. The SD700 has a serious micrphone problem: the overall volume is extremely low, and there is a pronounced hissing noise that dominates the video. This happens at all settings. I have owned other Canon digitals, both large and small and have not had this problem. The primary reason I bought this model was for the image stabilizer, which I found does not really make enough difference to be worth the price. My "old" Powershot SD200 takes better photos and video. FYI, I emailed Canon's service/repair/warranty department about this issue over a month ago, just to see if there was anything that could be done about the video problem and they ignored me. Fortunately I am not dependent on them for help and can just return my camera to the place I bought it. Rethinking my brand loyalty...
__label__1 Bait and switch: the come hither of the 18th century: The cover alone promises a walk on the wild side of Georgian England, a You ar There version of every bodice ripper ever written.In reality, this ia a rather dry compendium of stories, arranged by category of sin (pickpockets, bawds, highwaymay, foot-pads) with no real connecting link, no development of insight into the conditions and mores of the time.Disappointing
__label__2 Great Book: Fantastic book, Richard really pulls off a great story of struggle. Also includes several other short stories, which are also great.
__label__2 When the point isn't to be deep.: I truly enjoyed this book because it allowed me to lighten up about "choices" or "dilemmas" or whatever you want to call them. I understand and appreciate the need for self-evaluation, analysis, curiousity, sharing, and developing. I do, however, sometimes need to not go there.Many people complain this book didn't have the depth they would have liked. There is no depth, but the point isn't to be deep. I feel like the word "absurd" (used in the description on the COVER) points that out pretty clearly. For what it aims to do, the book does well. This book is a great reminder that *sometimes* all that evaluation/analysis stuff just is too much -- missing the point and ruining the fun of life.
__label__2 Fun, but with a couple of issues: This game is a definitely a lot of fun and a good way to sink some time, but I do have a couple of minor complaints: 1) I'm not a big fan of how you can't save a game while in the middle of dungeon crawling; if you get killed by the boss, you have to go all the way through the dungeon to get back to that encounter. . . and 2) way too many "random" encounters in the dungeons. I enjoy a fight as much as the next RPG-er, but not so much that I like finishing one fight, taking two steps, and having another one. . .over and over and over.Other than those issues, I do really like the game.
__label__1 bball review: Here's the deal with this bball system...The instructions are bad, flat out inaccurate in some points. My rim ended up being 3 inches short of 10 feet and the backboard is tilted backwards at the top. Not particularly steady when the ball hits the rim and board; the rim is dead and the whole thing shakes. I would not recommend this to a friend. Sorry Spaulding, but that's the truth...
__label__2 Necessity: I thought this book was excellent. It's a must read/great reference for the serious student of the western mystic tradition.My only caution would be to be careful. This isnt really "paperback" kind of material, and Im not sure about the wisdom of making it so public.
__label__1 Poorly written: This has to be one of the most poorly written books that I have ever read. I didn't expect Shakespeare, but give me a break. It was difficult to read, making it hard to understand the ideas that the author was trying to convey.
__label__1 Be Advised!: Be advised. Despite what Amazon states here, this product Will Not Work on a HP 111 Designjet Printer. You need a HP 82 Black Ink cartridge. Unfortunately did not find this out till after package was opened. Which negates a return. Ended up calling HP, who confirmed that yes. The 82 is the proper black cartridge.Would like to add this is why I rated this a one star. Nothing was wrong with the packaging. And as always when dealing with Amazon the product arrived promptly.
__label__2 Irish folklore: This is an old book that I finally read...it was hard to get through, there was so much hardship. It was a sad/funny tome on poverty and politics in Ireland.
__label__1 Features, but hardly works: I've been a Roxio/ EZ CD Creator user for many years. This version and suite packs a lot of features - everything you need for multimedia it seems.Has a lot of programs that start in the background and run all the time - they use quite a bit of your memory. It also hangs, or just refuses to open components. I often have to reboot in order for it to do what I want to get done (and I have a decent PC, working in the IT business). I have not gotten a slideshow to complete - it always locks up using all the cpu and I have to kill it. The videowave version gives me so many problems I generally give up and open Videowave version 4.1 - can you believe it, so much better! I can still burn CDs great, but anything else it just raises my blood pressure. What a waste of money.
__label__2 The Lady's Tutor: I just loved this book. Robin Schone is a great writer. I especially loved how the heroine realized the hero was for her and she forsake all she had to be with him. She gave up everything to be with him, even though he wasn't what her mother wanted for her. It was a very well written book.
__label__1 Insight into TV Journalism: This insight into TV journalism is about as interesting as a look into my parent's vacation to Florida. O'Reilly was obviously under the mistaken impression that his life in journalism and the places he traveled to were somehow fascinating enough to make into a work of fiction (or a work of anything, for that matter).And his main character: Tommy O'Malley (wasn't he one of the Aristocats?) About as dull and dumb as a bag of hammers (which someone ought to whack O'Reilly in the groin with).To sum up in a forthright, no-spin manner: this book sucks. I should have seen it coming, when my bid for eight dollars on Ebay was the only bid for five days, and turned out to be the winning bid (though, "winning" is hardly the term I'd use after listening to this piece of garbage). Since O'Reilly's a fan of torture, he ought to donate this audio CD for use in interrogating prisoners, if the Geneva Convention will allow it.
__label__2 This book is a must have for any Bush fan!: This book is a DEFINATE must have for any Bush fan! It makes you feel as though you actually went on the tour! The pics are candid and Peter Martin's captions are hilarious at times. Peter Black, the man who took the pics, is a close friend of the band, so they had nothing to hide. They were just themselves so in a way, after reading the book, you feel as though you know them!
__label__1 Good for a year: I agree with the recent reviews. Mysteriously, my printer stopped printing all of a sudden. It still scans and reads my media card. It will not print or run a self test. I contacted Epson and, after waiving the $9.95 fee to continue the phone call, they instructed me to clean the heads which did nothing but drain my cartiridges. I, too, went out and purchased all new cartridges. Still no improvement. I am in need of a new printer now and am tempted to buy another Epson only to get my money out of the new cartridges but I'm sure I'll buy a Lexmark instead. As a side note, before it quit, it did print beautifully..photos and text.
__label__1 Spend Your Time and Money Elsewhere: This book is the self involved, self indulgent ramblings of a man sorely in need of a focus, attention and an editor.Schechter's affluent upbringing and star-struck posturing unfortunately cannot mask his angry writing style which labors under the cute witicisms his young fans find so endearing on his website. This book is shallow and long-winded; spend your money and time elsewhere.
__label__1 verbal diarrhoea: the content was fascinating and definately worth reading in hard copy form, but the audio c/d was a nightmare. The narrator must have been hiring the recording studio by the minute because he read at a breakneck pace. At first it was acceptable , but soon became difficult to follow then tedious and annoying. The speed of the reading allowed for no digestion or comprehension of points , and soon was down right frustrating. As a consequence the second and third c/d's were almost a waste of time, I doubt if i could force myself to listen to it again, unless there was a way of play back at half speed.
__label__1 FOR WHOM THE BELL TROLLS: An original concept is sabotaged by the never-ending mockumentary trend in horror movies. This dubbed Norwegian entry is becoming a cult favorite and I frankly can't understand its appeal. It's not really funny nor scary. The troll effects are okay, and there's a certain ingenuity in the various troll appearances. But the movie is incredibly slow and the jerky camera work is nauseating. The script is mundane at least in the dialogue department and the ending way too abrupt, not that I was sorry to see it end.I'll be glad when the lost tapes fad fades and movie-makers rely on story and skill instead of tired gimmicks.
__label__1 Inconsistant with ERB storyline: Pathetic. Mr. Farmer didn't even get the timeline right. If Tarzan lived among the apes until 20 and was 30 in this book (stated twice) then Tarzon's son was a maximum age of 9 years old. In the ERB books, Jack was full grown and rescued Tarzan & Jane at the end of the Pal-ul-don book. It doesn't work. I read this thing to the tedious end- hoping for some time travel explain this blatent error. No such luck. I also got really tired of three and four word sentances. This manuscript is dumbed down to the 3rd grade reading level. "Tarzan never shivered" "Tarzan was surprised" "He became dizzy" Yuck. This book is an imposter! NOT a real Tarzan novel.
__label__2 Nice Play: Secrets of a kept woman (the play) was a nice presentation. This was the first stage production by established author Shani Dowdell and although the set design was a bit lacking...the plot and story line was very good. The actors deserve much praise for their performances.
__label__2 The kids can't dance to it...: It's still good, though. Most haters (as our hip-hop friends say) are unhappy because this cd is slow. Only three uptempo tracks (note to Mark Bell: when "Freelove" becomes a single, use the maximal chorus version). The title is obviously slightly ironic, since the cd is more hypnotic than exciting. But can anyone deny that each song is strong? Martin's favorite themes - being under the thrall of a powerful lover ("When the Body Speaks," "Goodnight Lovers") - are harped on here, but the collection has new ideas, too ("Freelove," "I Feel Loved" (which sounds like Erasure) and "I Am You"). Haters are unhappy that there aren't more obvious pop hooks, but this cd has more potential singles than any DM album except Violator. Best of all, Exciter really holds together; it has a consistent and seductive feel. It may not make you get to your feet and boogie now, but it will grow into a perennial favorite, like Astral Weeks or Pornography.
__label__2 One of the BEST: Danger on Deception Island was very fun. I liked the Seamanship quiz, and going out on the kayak and looking for clams. The messages in the bottles and what you did with them was VERY creative. The Orca was adorable, also. There were not many puzzles, but the ones that we DID have to solve were simple, yet difficult. The ONLY problem I had with this game, is that whenever you would go too far when you were in the kayak, you would need a second chance. AND, the first time I played the game, I didn't know to put on the helmet before I got on the bike, and I needed a second chance RIGHT AWAY. But overall, it was very fun and exciting.
__label__1 The Dutch version of new wave: There are some ok songs on this cd but over all the feeling I get is that most are weak in melody and structure and the distorted vocals are annoying. I think the Nits wanted to sound more and more like the Beatles and I stopped enjoying the Beatles a long time ago. The lead singer has a distinctive Dutch accent when singing in English. More interesting the Nits albums were Tent and the follow up. I don't remember the title because both albums are not available anymore, which is a shame because they are decent new wave albums for a Dutch band. None of the songs are featured on this "best off" cd. That's another shame.
__label__2 pretty barbie: i believe this was my oldest daughter's first barbie. i don't remember how much i paid for it but i certainly know it wasn't more than fifty bucks. this is the oldest barbie in the house and the most played with. she's a very beautiful barbie.
__label__1 too big: I purchased this item because I had other brands and was always satisified but unable to find them again. When I saw that this item was almost the same I bought it only to find that it was extremely too big to fit on any of my counter tops. I returned it immediately.
__label__1 Showed Promise but Fizzled Quickly: I'll give this an A for effort. It starts out as a compelling suspense but after forty minutes of going in a circle about "the question" it soon turns lame. The only thing that hooks you is finding out what's gonna happen in the end but it's not because the writing is great, just for curiosity's sake.The premise of the film was nothing unique and has been done better in other movies. The film was draggy in spots and the ending was disappointing. With such a buildup I expected a great climax.Unfortunately the ending just left me more confused and assured me I should've given up on the film after half an hour.Skip it. It's nothing new or interesting.
__label__2 strong film making: The director of Flight 93 shows his talent is no fluke with this mesmerizing retelling of this horrific peace march.
__label__2 1972-73 season: I have purchased all 5 yrs of the Doris Day show. I've watched half of this season and it's a big improvement over the 4th season. The 4th season was terrible and I'm surprised it was renewed for a 5th. Doris seems to have gotten used to the show's format. It changed so many times in it's run. I would recommend buying seasons 2,1,5,3,4 in that order. I never watched this show during it's original run, since I was only a baby. I'm not a big fan of Doris' but this is a good family show, even if it's a little boring sometimes. It's definitly not as good as "Mary Tyler Moore show", but maybe as good as "That girl". They should have kept Rosie Marie in the cast, she left after season 3 and the supporting players are nothing special in this show. It's definitely all about Doris Day. So if you like her, you should love this show.
__label__1 Nice looking but an Expensive one trick pony: The new Kindle 2 is a nice looking device compared with the original. But it is still a one trick pony---basically a very expensive e-book reader. It has several negatives:Expensive to buy.Basically an e-book reader, other uses like wireless browsing either cost extra (wireless fees--see wireless agreement) or aren't offered.No back-lite for dark low light settings.DRM on purchased e-books.Relatively expensive costs for e-book content ($9.99 & up)For my money, buy an iPhone, Blackberry, etc & get the whole nine yards of connectivity, then download Stanza or other free e-book readers. This will allow you to get tons of free classics from Gutenberg project & you can add recent audio books to your computer & sync them with your device.

__label__2 Be in Control is Natural and Fun: Jason Alster is a multi-talented author with a specialty in natural treatments for attention and learning differences. In Being in Control, the Alster packs short, yet effective techniques in a forty-page book to help young people in their personal, creative and scholastic lives. The book is engaging visually with colorful photos and illustrations. Being in Control continues seamlessly from one-page topics that cover four basic areas: problem-solving, self-help, hands-on approach (tools to make and use. Fun!), and success in school. Alster has written a shining self-help book for children of all ages, including teens. And since I like books that capture my attention, you could say it would be a good read for adults, too.
__label__2 Don't Overlook This Gem!: I have a feeling that because this book is long out of print, and has the generic title "Coins and Collectors", that more advanced numismatists pass over this work. In this book you get the often overlooked side of the history of collecting coins in America. The images in the book are worth the price of admission. It's a short read at a little over 200 pages, but if you love coins, but don't know when collecting got popular in America and what the forces were that caused it's popularity through the years, then this book is for you. You'll learn the names of the greats in the hobby and the great publications, things you can't learn by just reading the red book and buying a Liberty Nickel or two.
__label__2 Delving and distinctive: Chris Church's random review is catchy. And I agree with him, and so do I with the others who gave their comments. These Brit lads helped define a decade and its energetic excesses with their music. They made 80s music filled with life. Their lyrics slithers into the psyche a piece of what is awful and true. They fashioned a music beat that is not only trendy but also synthed with moody beats that are not thumpy but are either danceable or swingy. Everybody Wants To Rule the World, Pale Shelter, Change, Start of the Breakdown, Mad World and Memories Fade, The Way You Are and The Working Hour are all sign-of-the-times tunes that transcend the mind. Most of all I find several of their songs and most of their albums a combination of simultaneously happy, reflective and melancholic masterpieces. A singing group brimming with forethoughts.
__label__1 Do not buy this for a road bike...the high tire pressure just spits out the slime.: I got a puncture in the tube on the 35th mile of a 65 mile ride. The slime tube STILL ENDED UP FLATTING because the high pressure of the tire just spit out the SLIME and the puncture didn't seal. I've owned Slime tubes for mountain bikes and they work fine for that. I rate it 1 star for road bike use...an absolute waste of money.
__label__1 Very Low Quality: These are not the York Peppermint Patties that I am accustomed to. They are very noticeably made of lower quality ingredients. After I took a single bite I could tell something was wrong, so I checked the packaging and sure enough these are manufactured in Mexico (I saw on another variety here on Amazon that people were complaining about the quality of the 'Made in Mexico' York Peppermint Patties). This product is a waste of money.
__label__2 Best 8/16bit game Ever (actually 2nd - FF5 is the best): There is no real improvement over the Japanese SNES version. But it puts it in that little gameboy where you can play it longer (10hrs / 2 AA) and in more places than you can the translated SNES ROM on ZSNES on a laptop (3hrs/battery, only playable on airplanes while traveling, some trains). Dragon Warrior 3 is the best RPG game out there for NES/SNES except for Final Fantasy 5 (also Japan only except on a Playstation legacy compilation CD). Took me 60 hours to beat the game. Potential for 100+hours of gameplay if you want to work the class system good. The DW3GBC / DQ3-R SNES game is MUCH IMPROVED over the DW3/DQ3 NES Version.;
__label__1 CHEAP SHEETS: Should have known for this price that they would SUCK !!! They pill, or shed everywhere. I washed them and two of the four corners on the fitted sheet tore. Don't bother...pay more for better quality.
__label__1 Needs replacing too fast: I, too, find that I have to replace the cartridges WAY too fast for the small amount of printing I do -- and cartridges for this model are NOT refillable.I have to replace the magenta and yellow cartridges again, but when they're empty I'm buying a better printer.
__label__1 Did not receive the watch!!!: I have not received the watch!!Where is it????You charged my credit card but I never got the watch.Richard Siefert8596 Alessandria CtNaples, FL 34114239-732-5885
__label__1 Isn't there a larger version of this game??: This is too small for the age of child it's designed for. I swear there used to be a larger version. Plus, it didn't survive more than a few sessions of our play group before the spring broke.
__label__2 low level: this album is really some of the folkiest, piniest music you can find outside of folkways. i highly recommend it, but i will warn that the recording levels on this album are so low, that even with stereo at full blast, some guitar-strumming is hard to hear. if you want really down-home at its best, though, you're gonna have to deal with the drawback.
__label__1 blatant satanism: the first novel is geared to draw you in, it is the icing on the cake, it look interesting, but the second novel reveal the purpose of the trilogy: the rebellion of the dark angels against God. Of course, God is the meany and the dark angels are the "good guys". Blatant satanism in other words. The author serves the father of lies and after reading him you feel unclean.
__label__2 Awesome...mysterious: Janet wants a horse bad, and her parents wont even let her buy half ownership in one. Angry, Janet goes to bed and dreams that she is riding a mystical white mare...and finds out the mare is real and that its owners are living in the arroyo. Or are the mare and her owners real? You'll find out! It is a mysterious book. I loved it. It tingles the senses. The only problem is, Janet is acting like a brat because the white gelding, a lesson horse she rides, isn't perfect and beautiful with a flowing mane and able to jump five feet, so she's mean to it. She acts like the only horses are those who jump the moon and have brilliant color and dainty legs and are like dogs.
__label__2 Book over Kindle edition: I purchased the Leonaur paperback edition of this book and found it very enthralling, and a very interesting insight into the dangers, struggles and adventures that pioneers faced in the American Frontier of old.
__label__2 Great Timer but no longer available.: This product is great if you can find it. I do have one I purchased last summer at Lowe's. Unfortunately the manufacturer has discontinued it. It was listed on Amazon but after ordering it, the seller contacted me to say it was no longer available.
__label__2 Bratz Rock!: this doll is so cute i love her bootsps: just so you all know this fight about if bratz and my scene are better just stop it is stupid personally i hate my scene and love bratz but people just make peace with this doll war!
__label__2 Cypress Keeps It Real on IV: The months flow by, seasons change, and rappers blow up---only to disappear seemingly overnight. Such is the nature of the hip hop industry...what is hot today is old news next week.Cypress Hill are the exception to this trend. Back in 1991 they hit the scene in a big way with their first joint, containing the classics "How I Could Just Kill a Man" and "Hand On The Pump".Their latest release, IV, does not disappoint. The tracks are a lot deeper, and the flow of B Real and Sen is tight. The song topics don't deviate too much; there is plenty of cop-hating, weed smoking, and automatic weapons. The thing is, Cypress knows how to come correct and make you play the cd til you know every word.Some of the best songs on this album are "Tequila Sunrise", "Lightning Strikes", and "Dead Men Tell No Tales".If you like Cypress even just a little bit, go get this ablum.
__label__1 Slows down the computer!: The main problem with this software is that it boggs down the computer while you're surfing the net. Pages that used to come down in 3 seconds took 15 seconds or more to come down. I eventually just uninstalled it because it was driving my kid crazy. I bought CyberSitter instead and that's working great.
__label__2 Pyramid RPR425 4 Gauge Power Wire: My grandson used this wire to connect his speaker system up in his "new" car. I can assure you that the wiring works, I hear that radio thumping all the time:). Thus far, he hasn't had any problems, i.e. wire burning or melting.
__label__2 Delicious Collection of Many Kinds of Breads: You know this is my favorite bread cookbook because this is where I stick news clippings of other bread recipes! The standout feature is the many variations on themes of breads, and they're all delicious. You will find recipes from other countries that perhaps you've wondered before about making. Highly recommended.
__label__1 Kind of boring: It wasn't a terrible story just not that interesting. I was never on the edge of my seat. For a thriller it was pretty timid. I will not be reading anymore of the Louis Kincaid stories.
__label__1 Resolution not impressive: I was not impressed with the resolution. While some have considered it thoughtful and clever, I found it disappointing. The Author is articulate and certainly does not suffer from the lack imagination. Nevertheless, like many other books that entertain you with their language, this is a good read for that reason along.
__label__1 Do I Hear.... REMIX 2!!!: When I first heard the single 'Jenny From The Block', I was anticipating for it's release and wondering if the rest of the cd sound just as good. I was also hoping she'd produce another dance tune like, 'Waiting For Tonight' or 'Feel'n So Good' since they were hits at the clubs. Instead there were a lot of bad ballads with awful lyrics and songs with the same beat. Overall this cd sounds like a really long, and may I add 'BORING', love letter to BEN AFFLECK. Hopefully her collaboration with Hex Hector, Thunderpuss, David Morales, or anyone can help her revive some of the songs in this cd.The only songs that stand out are:1 Still (cool intro, but they should've spent more time on this song, hopefully there's a remix radio edit in progress)2 All I Have 'featuring LL Cool J' (i really think this song should be in an LL Cool J cd and should read "All I Have, featuring Jennifer Lopez")3 Jenny From The Block (cool first single, she looks HOT in the video)
__label__2 Great Book and Fast shipping: I needed this book asap for class. It arrived the very fast within a day or two. It was in great condition and very helpful. Great seller.
__label__2 Rush owns live albums: This is the first of many incredible live albums by Rush circa 1976. I had this one on cassette back in the day, wore that thing out! A great live version of 2112 on this one, plus Something for Nothing and a Working Man/Finding my Way melody that is out of sight.
__label__2 Voodoo Magic: Nice mystery. A little romance, the suggestion of voodoo magic and humor made it a very easy book to read. Really enjoyed the characters and the background including the health food shop.
__label__2 Great Bokken: I am in no way an experienced swordsman, but I feel that this bokken is great. It is considerably lighter than an actual katana, but I think most bokkens are that way. It is very impact resistant to the point of being almost indestructible. Once I accidentally hit a support beam/pillar with full force (don't ask -_-) and I found no trace of damage on the bokken. The only flaw I see is that polypropylene is not as dense as wood so the bokken is easily damaged by sharp objects and can be cut by bladed weapons. This is not really an issue unless you decide to channel musashi and fight a katana with a bokken.
__label__1 Spore: SporeCame here to buy the game, read about the DRM hassle and decided not to buy. Pity for the designers, hope EA learns from the protests and missed sales.
__label__1 Not horrible soup, but it's not miso: It's almost impossible to make miso soup without using dashi, the Japanese stock made from dried fish flakes. For this reason, miso soup by definition is never vegetarian. Yet "Miso-Cup" tries this for the sake of remaining vegetarian.So what you get in these packets is a somewhat bland-flavored veggie-tasting soup. There are other miso packets out there, some even contain dried dashi powder. But, the best miso is still home-made, with real or powdered dashi.
__label__1 For Dummies is Right!: Unless you know absolutely NOTHING about German Shepherds then I would not recommend buying this book. It gives only the most basic of knowledge, and in my opinion is not worth your time. Find a better book if you really want to learn about training or behavior!
__label__1 This is a Costco dud: This Sharp TV is NOT sharp! Cheap, but you do get what you pay for. We were told at Costco that "Don't worry, this isn't a discontinued model or anything like that". Baloney. That's just what it is. The picture is marginal at best. Do yourself a big favor and spend a few more dollars to upgrade!
__label__1 Forget it, try Letters at 2 AM instead: I really tried, but couldn't get past the first chapter of this book. I'd picked it up after falling in love with Letters at 2 AM. My theory is that he's a great essayist but not a great novelist. If this is the only one you've tried, don't give up. Check out Letters at 2 AM, a brilliant, honest, collection of essays.
__label__2 One of the best original FPS you can play!!!: This game is one of the best first person shooter games I had ever played! I had tried all of the xbox first person shooters and this is defitenitely the best for me since Halo! The graphics are excellent and the originality is awesome! This game is so good that it is worth buying it. You will not regret it. Like Halo I will never resell mine because I cannot wait to replayed again and again!!!
__label__2 A Masterpiece of Mystic Poetry: This is a beautiful book, filled with poems that not only touch the heartstrings, but uplift and expand the spirit. In the West we've had some great mystic poets (St. John of the Cross, et al), but in my opinion, these verses surpass in beauty and inspiration anything of their kind written to date.While reading Whispers one can sense that Yogananda was a great lover of God. As one continues to read, one feels the author's mood overcoming one's own. It steals over and enthralls you, drowning out the noisy world with the power of inner rapture and silence.Whether or not you are of devotional temperament, if you love beauty and goodness, you would appreciate this book.Richard Salva--author of Soul Journey from Lincoln to Lindbergh [UNABRIDGED]
__label__2 I CAN SING!: I have finally learned how to sing! if anyone is serious about learning to sing, they MUST get this book.The content of this book contains SUCH valuable information, information that is crucial to know if you want to be a singer. The Cd's have transformed my voice. At first it felt like my vocal chords were getting a good work out, now they feel strong. I can feel them stretch, I use her Cd's everyday to make my voice stronger and to maintain my newly developed singing capabilities! I was seriously considering giving up singing, then I bought her book and finally learned HOW to sing. It did not take a long time and it was easy and fun.Dena is so knowledgable and has such a passion for the voice, she is also such a wonderful person.Thank you Dena Murray, You were a God Sent.
__label__2 EDF Coming In!: The number of AI bots, Weapons, Technology, Troopers, Destructible environments Ext. is astounding. A game that launches entire armies at you and you get to blast them away. Excellent feel and game play, a totally fun adventure.
__label__2 This should stop the Whiners!!!: "Gritty" describes it ... and so does "progress." What really hit home with me was what I experienced about myself: I overrate both my guilt and my effect. There are some things that happened that really weren't my fault! But seeiung that these things don't happen again? That is all on me. Linda is in that wonderful place!So, if you think you had it rough, dig in ... some damn ride!!!
__label__2 Sense and Sensibility: It is a truth universally acknowledged that there is no current literary critic who writes as brilliantly as James Wood. His metaphoric precision, his moral rigor, his exacting standards of literary excellence, his humanistic compassion dwarfs all competitors for the title. One would have to revert to Lionel Trilling, Edmund Wilson and Alfred Kazin to find comparable peers and, except perhaps for Trilling, I feel he outshines them all. Luckily we are not reduced to reading only one writer for insight and thoughtful exploration of literature's richness and follies. But in this, his newest volume of essays, he demonstrates once again why his writing remains indispensible.
__label__1 the noise deafened their brains...: i'll agree that the action and the lighting and the costumes were all very impressive for the first twenty minutes of this "Matrix shoot 'em up rip." Once the actors started talking plot and motivation, however, the entire picture fell apart. The "Awakening"?--is this a leftover Buffy episode?Kate Beckinsale was fine; Shane Brolly as her sexist leader were dreadful. Scott Speedman (one can't judge his skill because he had nothing to do) had the worst part of all, the MacGuffin--or plot mover. He was just tossed around until his big stunt double fight scene at the end.As for plot, the motivation was right out of an afternoon serial. These are creatures of supposed mythic proportions at the end of a centuries old battle...for this? oh, please...It's a darn shame that so much talent in other areas and visual potential was wasted on this flimsy piece of drivel.Let's hope that the sequel will have a bit more thought--and some real characters--behind it.
__label__1 Uneven Comfort: We do not sleep with the heater on in winter and the interior temperature in our house is usually around the mid-50s. My wife bought this comforter after reading all the good reviews but we were disappointed when we unpacked the item. First of all, the fill in each baffle box is extremely uneven. Some are puffy and full. Many are not only thin but lumped to one side of the box, leaving areas with nothing but the two sheet of cover fabric in my hand. Then, many of the stitches across the baffle box did not even sewn through leaving big gaps for the fill materials to migrate. We were just about to return it but instead we decided to skip the hassle and keep it in the guest room.
__label__2 chock-o-block full of insights: This book is packed full of insights and case studies. Extremely readable. I found myself picking it up again and again, reading and re-reading various chapters. An excellent field guide as to how you can and others have tapped into the power of buzz. A must read for anyone involved in marketing. It should be added to every business school's reading list.
__label__1 Crap: The size of this unit makes it appear that it can handle a very long length of hose. It is quite heavy when attached to the exterior brick and you know that eventually your anchors are going to pull out from the weight. Last but not least, the spool is completely broken in half after less than a year. I have now been bitten 3 times on Suncast products. I would give this zero stars if I could. I will definitely tell my husband not to waste any more money on this brand when he is at Lowes.
__label__1 so LOUD!!: My sons were very excited to get their new fish nightlights but the larger one (the XS was fine) makes some squeaking/grinding noises and is so loud we haven't been able to use it at all. There is no return information so I have been trying to fix it but if we can't, then we'll just have to throw it away. I don't recommend this to anyone. Like my husband said "STOP BUYING JUNK ONLINE"!!!
__label__2 Beginners guide is Useful: It's pretty good to review from time to time. I have some friends from Mexico who help me with the pronuncations. I did notice the word Mensaje, which means message, was missing from the book. I don't think the sentences used are street lingo but it'll get you by. I'd recommend getting it just so you can understand the sentence structure.
__label__2 Pay more if you want, BUT Why?: Using this cable to connect an LG 32LG60 1080P HDTV to the LG BD300 Blue Ray player and can not say enough about the quality of the images transmitted via this cable. Up-converted DVD's are too sharp as one should not need to see every strand of hair in someone's head nor their pores! Sound is Fantastic!Buy the >$20.00 cable or monster if you have the money, I purchaesd 4 of these and with shipping it was <$20.00's plus I bought lunch!
__label__2 "These guys are sharp", says 3-fingered brotherinlaw Bob: Wow, I wish the little lady had warned me.These beautiful steak knives are a high quality addition to our Henckel stainless flatware. These knives will cut through the meanest brisket just like it's soft butter. But, please be careful, or at least assign someone to have a cup of ice ready. Just a word to the wise. Hey, he was a jerk anyway.
__label__2 Surprise Your Friends with Highway Trivia!: Clearly this topic will not be of interest to everybody but for those with an interest in history and the often surprising reasons behind the highway system in the U.S., this book is a joy. You will astound your friends with trivia! How many of them know that Maryland contains the most-expensive (per toll mile) interstate in the Country? (How many of your friends might care, is another story).Altough it seems to be written in high-school textbook prose, the chapters are well organzined, the photos are wonderful and the format lends itself to the coffee table. It can be read in almost any order, a chapter at at time or even a sidebar at a time.I now have an appreciation for the engineering marvel that Americans take for granted every day.
__label__2 A much needed reference!: Wow. I'd been looking for this book. A long overdue additionto the C and C++ pocket reference. This book is just what it said it would be - a UML reference book. Easily fits in thebackpack (or lost on the desk). I look forward to other books written by Mr. Pilone. This one is easy to read, informativeand well worth what I paid for it. It would have been a five star book, but it's a pocket reference!
__label__2 Slammin&Thumpin": I have the this Version of the Greatest Hits&the first edition of it as well minus "Kick it to the curb".Brothers Johnson hit you with Tight in the Pocket Grooves Slapping Bass Solid Production with Quincy Jones doing His thing with His People&the Brothers Johnson.Rod Temperton bringing His Writing Genius&touch there way as well."Stomp" alone is a Jam that still Lights up my Sound system.Burning Funky Grooves&Sing-along Jams that are timeless.
__label__1 Outdated Material: Read this book from cover to cover as an experienced archer and thought most of the information was superfluous. Authors tried to cover all aspects in a very brief amount of time and text. Methods are too standard stated in a matter-of-fact manner disregarding other theories, practices and methods. This book might be good for a boy scouts counselor but not a serious archer with goals of competition and proficiency. All illustrations are hand drawn leaving out critical detail.
__label__1 Time resets to random times: I've had Sony Dream machines for years as my bed side clock, and I was excited to buy this one. What a mistake. The time regularly just jumps to a random time in the middle of the night. Because of this, I've been late to work a few times. I can not stress how disappointed I am, or discourage people strongly enough not to buy this alarm clock.
__label__2 Schooner Fare: Closer to Wind Excellent Album hard to find.: An excellent but not well known group. I was very happy to find the album on Amazon,I had been looking for it everywhere(I Tunes, FYI.and others) for a long time. Most if not all of their albums are available on Amazon. You can sample theirmusic on an mp3 titled "Calgary" also available on Amazon. I hope you like them as much as I do.Closer to the Wind
__label__2 Flawed but wonderful...: This is John's second best album...right behind "Church with One Bell." Same Valium-laced blend of jazz and blues...but this time written by the artist. Outstanding...but not quite up to the masterpiece standards of "Church." concisereport@mindspring.com
__label__2 Continual fun for ages 2+: Of course kids are all different, this toy may not hold the interest of a child with little interest in pretend play cooking. However, I think the vast majority of children will LOVE it. I have a 2 yr old & a 4 yr old & both play with it constantly. Younger ones may not comprehend so much that they are decorating a birthday cake, but the facination of adding and subtracting the decorations (velcro candles, candies, strawberries) is great. I think the construction is good; nothing broken yet. Only down side to it is collecting up all those circles (candies/strawberries) & candles! I'd recommend this gift for boy and girl (I've got both).
__label__1 CONTAINS SOY- A common food allergen: Not listed are the "other ingredients" Gelatin, Magnesium Silicate, Potassium chloride, Croscarmellose Sodium, Polysorbate, SOY LECITHIN, purified water, Silica, MCT, Vegetable Stearic Acid, Magnesium Stearate and Potassium Aspartate.
__label__1 More like Melrose Place than Dallas.: As someone who owns the past 14 seasons of Dallas on DVD, a HUGE problem with the new Dallas is that it doesn't "feel" even remotely like the "old" Dallas. Unfortunately, it feels like 10 bad episodes of Melrose Place instead. I don't care for the writing or the casting. Aside from Linda Gray, the original cast look really, really old, which is disappointing. I can't help but feel that they should have left Dallas alone.
__label__2 One of my Favorite Woods Books: I have read all of Stuart Woods books and this one and palindrome seem to have become my favorites. I recently reread New York Dead and it was once again a fresh and enjoyable read. I had a hard time putting it down for the second time. Like most of his books they are are a good fast read with characters who pull you into the story.
__label__2 Great pressure canner - works for quarts and pints: I've read reviews about this canner not working for quarts. That's wrong. I use it to pressure can quarts all the time. I like this size because for just my husband and me, I don't need to can great quantities of food at a time. This canner will do 7 quarts - and that's plenty for me. The few times that I've had more than 7 quarts of food, I've just set the extra in the refrigerator until the first set was finished. No big deal. The other advantage to this size pressure canner is that it's not as heavy as the larger AA canners. This is a well made, substantial pot - and it is HEAVY. I'm in my 60s, and I would have a difficult time managing a larger canner. This 15 1/2 quart canner is perfect for my needs. In the past few weeks I've canned tomato soup, split pea soup, potato-leek soup, hoppin' john, chili, sweet and sour chicken, and lots of dried beans and peas. This past summer I canned many quarts of tomatoes, salsa and beans. It's great.
__label__1 Perfect for the price EXCEPT the BAD ODOR!: I was very excited to find these for the price with a plus of free shipping with Amazon Prime (I buy at least 5 times a month from Amazon, so it's worth it). I re-sell DVD's and like to replace the cases so there clean and fresh! I've been paying double so I was absolutely ecstatic to cut my cost in half! Even with the word PREMIUM in the title I knew for the price, I would be getting a low-end product but I was willing to give them a try. They are perfect EXCEPT for one problem. THEY LITERALLY STINK! I can't really describe it but to me it's like a burnt plastic smell with sour notes! My daughter said it smells like pee! This is disappointing. Maybe it's just the batch I received. I'm trying to air them so maybe it will dissipate and be tolerable!
__label__2 One of a Kind: Sometimes, when you finish the last page of a book you suddenly realize that you'll never find another book quite like it. I had that same experience with Lord of the Flies. My only consolation is that I can read it again and again.
__label__1 Good idea, bad implementation: It's a decent read, but the presentation was too loose. Felt like reading some reader's digest short story. The content was not bad, the guy definately knows what he's talking about. Sometimes I felt his style was like he was trying to explain sex to a 8 yr old kid.
__label__2 Excellent: It is clear to me that the Holy Spirit sings through her voice. I love her very much. May God bless her always.
__label__2 Great kid album: My 5-yr-old son got this for his birthday and looooves it. So do his little friends. They've never seen the CBS show (of course) but they love pretending they're castaways and foraging for food on an island. This album plays a big part in their games.And believe me, it's a heck of a lot better than listening to the usual kiddie music. You know, the kind that makes you feel like you're in "A Clockwork Orange"? I totally recommend this for any parent.
__label__1 Not Grandma's favorite: Glad I read this before giving it to my grand daughter. A pet cat captured by goblins and roasting over an open fire did not appeal to me and I am sure it would have given her nighmares for weeks. One doesn't have to have a PHD in child development to know that kids do not like stories where animals don't win out in the end. These goblins are also very cruel to an injured griffin - not character traits I wish exemplified in any child.
__label__1 why are we supposed to like this....: This was 1970's cheese. It's awful. I can see why Lynda Carter's career never took off, she is awful in acting. As for the costume and the scripts, let's not go there. I used to like this show, but it has aged poorly.
__label__1 Lasted all of 3 minutes: We had high hopes for this pillow for our 2 year old. Unfortunately, the pillow ripped apart almost immediately after we opened the package. Buckwheat everywhere -- not a good choice for small children.
__label__2 Love my Kindle!: I received my Kindle in March and absolutely love it! I mainly got one because most paperbacks have such small print that my eyes tire after reading a chapter. With the Kindle, you can increase the print size to be easy on the eyes. We went to the beach a couple of weeks ago and when someone would tell me about a good book, I could find it and download sitting right out on the beach. It's easy to grab and take with you anywhere. I do wish the 2nd ed. Kindle could take a memory card for extra storage. I can't figure out why they left that feature off. Nevertheless, I wouldn't take anything for my Kindle!!!
__label__1 What a waste of money!: I actually bought this book after reading the bad reviews. I thought that maybe the reviewers were judging too harshly...they weren't. If I could give this book zero stars I would, but I guess I'll have to settle for giving it a very low one star. I finished this book in just a few hours, not because it was so engrossing, but because the story was horrible and I could skip several pages, and not miss anything. This was no where near a sensual romance. It was just stupid. What happend miss Devine?
__label__1 Scratches easily: I am sure it protects my eTrex Legend well but the display foil scratches so easily that I have to pull the GPS unit out of the case every time I want to check it. A sock would do the same job.
__label__1 not heavy duty vinyl: This curtain is the right size since I'm looking for something over 88" long unfortunately its not heavy duty vinyl. I do not think it will hold up very long despite having metal grommets. The curtain that I am replacing is a much heavier vinyl and has lasted for years.
__label__2 very good game: This game excited me so much i bought a game boy ds. This game started off fantastically but after i beat it i got very bored with it. Some stars are very boring and confusing to obtain. The new stars on the game are no very fun to get. They mostly involve collected 5 silver stars(which is lame because it is 2 much like collecting red coins)or hitting a switch and running to the star fast enough when it appears. But i really loved the mario on the 64 and the new charecters(yoshi,luigi,wario) are fun to play as. But this is basically the same game as the n64 and if u collected all the stars earlier you will find it boring to do the same again. 4/5.
__label__2 It was very entertaining and sexy: I haven't known the group's music that long but I have listened to samples from the CD and must say that its a very entertaing and sexy album and the guys sound great. My favourite is meeting in my bedroom,and I first heard it when my boyfriend played it for me.
__label__2 Exactly as advertised: The vest fit perfectly and I had numerous compliments. It has been suggested as appropriate wear for Valentines Day. A must have for the holiday season.
__label__2 Works GREAT!!!: This product is exactly what I wanted... I had another one (different brand name) that went bad and needed a replacement.. I have had this for about 2 months now with NO trouble.. Only thing I find a bit difficult is placing water in the unit.. It has a small area to put it in and I often spill a little water on the counter. I would recommend this unit however... For great water for coffee also see [...]
__label__2 Great purchase: A coworker of mine had ordered this exact ball and I liked it so much I ordered one for myself. Great value, arrived promptly. This one is fairly large, but I am 6' so it works great for me, shorter folks might want to try one of the smaller ones.
__label__2 Talk about Motivational!: For anyone going through tough times, this book will help pick you up. Like the synopsis of the book says, he quit working a dead-end job for little money and had to figure out what to do to take care of his family. For anyone feeling lost in their job or in this economy, this will definitely motivate you. He went from loserville to one of the biggest financial successes in the country.....and he wasn't some engineer from an Ivy League school with special training. He just used his brain to figure out how to help people and, at the same time, make money. From that moment, his life story is just amazing and insprirational. A great American success story! And something everyone could emulate and raise their own life to another level.
__label__1 who needs a dvd for movie this old ?: Whoever is buying the bluray version will hardly ever view it in a DVD. Maybe the DVD is more about digital copy but I still just want a single BD disc with this movie in it, priced about $16.Just as some other reviewers have mentioned, I'm so sick of these silly 4 disc set releases, esp for older movies at this price.I don't care for the special features either.
__label__1 Suckfest!: I don't get it, I was amped up to read Tempted, I dig Lori Foster, I actually checked out the ratings before I bought it. I was suckered into Back in Black and it was a total fail. Tempted, TOTAL FAIL!
__label__1 Low Shelf Life: I bought this ice cream scoop a couple of years ago, thinking that I would have it for many years. I was wrong. As others have stated, the inner curve of the scoop started rusting. I also had a problem with the handle becoming full of water, and it doesn't come apart to get the water out, so it started molding inside the black handle piece. Really Nasty! My family of six eats lots of ice cream, so here I am, searching for a scoop with good reviews from people who have owned it for a while! Don't bother buying this one. It looks nice, at first, but the quality is unfortunately low.
__label__2 Great product: I bought this purse hanger for my girlfriend, because whenever we go out to a restaurant or bar, there usually is nowhere to hang her bag. She loves it and uses it all the time, she really likes that it folds up so small. It even works on some uneven surfaces because of the rubber bottom.
__label__1 Will not cover an 8 foot pool. Flimsy. Advertised as a solid piece (wrongly)!: I cannot get this small piece of flimsy film on my 8 foot pool because it is too small. Also, this is not a solid cover - another point of contention about appropriate advertising.
__label__2 Always Excellent!: I had not watched it in quite a few years. There was a lot about the movie I did forget like the fight scene in the "Kitchen" and the scene on the Balcony (towards the end) with Kevin & Whitney. Thank you much for the movie, it arrived in very good condition. One of the many movies I will treasure!
__label__1 Buzzing sound.. tempermental: I've had my fuji finepix for about 3 years. After the second year I dropped it from well not that far, ever since it makes a buzzing sound and chooses to work when it wants too. Half the time the lcd screen is dark indoors and sometimes the zoom does not work. I always blamed dropping it for it's issues, but apparently everyone else has had the same problem. I will be replacing it this year with a panasonic.
__label__2 Wonderful resource: This is my second copy of this book. Loved it, shared it, bought it again!Quick shipping, great condition.
__label__2 No Instructions: This is very useful if you have an older TV with no VGA port on it. However, there are no instructions with it as to how to set it up or anything. It came only in a ziploc bag with no other papers or even company info. You connect the VGA part to your computer, then the cords to your TV. Then on your computer, you go to the control panel and find Hardware section then it should say something about connecting a projector. You want Duplicate so you can still see your computer screen. Then you just have to play around with the settings on your TV input to find where it should be to play anything. Very difficult without instructions but works fine.
__label__1 Chris, VA: Crappy construction - I had to use vice grips to get the bolts in the holes because they were improperly drilled. The bed sags, won't stay level, and even the dog doesn't care for it.
__label__1 Blade Broke Off In My Food: I used to love this product just as many others do. Unfortunately, a small piece of the blade broke off in the food I was chopping, and if I hadn't seen it, my children could have swallowed the blade.Cuisinart sent a replacement blade, and recently this SECOND blade broke off into my food. After being well-informed of the danger, Cuisinart's only response has been to offer another of the same hazardous blade.
__label__2 AWESOME SOUNDTRACK!!!: This CD has some of the best songs in the game! The lyrics are included in the booklet.My Top Five:1. Throw It All Away (Shadow's Theme Song) This has great music2. E.G.G.M.A.N. (Eggman's theme song) Cool song, interesting lyrics.3. Live & Learn (main theme) Great music and singing4. It Doesn't Matter (Sonic's Theme Song) Good lyrics5. Escape From The City (City Escape) CatchyBUY THIS GAME!!!
__label__1 Not an easy read: I had trouble finishing this book. It did not keep my interest. I wanted to read about a near death experience.This was more about dreams and receiving messages through dreams.
__label__1 Dried up bag of crap!!!!: The bag of grass seed has'nt sprouted diddley, I've got pictures , it's the perfect weather and the rain is consistant, and to top it off, Iuse miricle grow garden soil of which I have pictures and reciepts !!!!IT'S GARBAGE ,PROBABLY LEFT OVER FROM LAST TEARS SALES.....
__label__1 Looks great sounds less than Ok at best settings.: I am glad to see Sony enter the Hard Drive MP3 player arena. This unit has great features great looks and a great feel. It falls way short however on sound quality. Compared to my current MP3 player, Pogo Products RipDrive, this unit just doesn't deliver a clear, rich or powerful sound. I tried ripping my CD's at all possible quality settings and types and the sound was not close enough to my RipDrive unit to keep me from being dissapointed. The Sony VGF-AP1L wins hands down on style looks and size. If you want to show off to your friends this looks great, but if you want to impress your ears try a RipDrive.
__label__1 Film as iconography: There are films that seem bad at first but open up when seen a second or third time. This is not one of them. The first two times I saw this film, it seemed incredibly beautiful to me. My jaw probably fell open the first time I saw it. But the third time was too much. The film is so incredibly silly and pretentious I almost felt like laughing at some of the scenes. At times it almost seems like a Saturday-Night-Live parody of an art film, e.g. the scene of the monks noisily chomping on pomegranites. A talent for visual composition and an interesting sound track are just not enough to make a good film. Paradjanov had one idea in this film ("Hey, I'll tell a story with a series of ikons!") and repeated it five hundred times. Even imagistically, there are many many far more impressive films than this one -- take Orson Welles' "Othello" as one underrated example. Among art films, there are A films, B films, and then there is this film.
__label__1 Potential: When I heard "Ordinary People" I thought this was going to be a great album. I don't generally listen to R&B all that much so I gave it a chance. The nice piano only accompanied by Legend's voice made it sound more natural and acoustic than anything I've heard that has been considered R&B. Unfortunately, the music, except for a few songs, sounds like almost all the other R&B I've heard; Hip-hop beats and rappers being in the songs. Even these great songs can't change the fact that this album was tarnished by popular crap that people tend to like in all cds. This cd had so much potential.
__label__2 Great overview of water storage comcepts: This book offers an excellent overview of water collection theory. Included are a few detailed build schematics, but this book relies heavily on owner ideas to creat a system dedicated to the individual. I got some great new ideas and can honestly recommend this read.
__label__1 Really C++ joke: Got stuck in Day 6 as another reader commented. The author indicating he used VisiBroker to do this, I even doubt he test those stuff, using VisiBroker, Day 6 example does NOT work!Read the code: 1) using free instead of delete in C++ 2) the Visibroker generated loop dependence of class was never mentioned.If you really need a CORBA book on C++, it seems the only good one is "Advanced Corba programming in C++ "Once I am good at CORBA, I will not write a book with the first example NOT working
__label__1 Not worth buying.: The plastic piece is cheap, mine broke when I was tightening it. Also the plastic piece doesn't do a very good job of keeping it tight. The product sucks and not worth buying unless you want to throw your money away.
__label__2 One of the Great WORLD Films: They say that European and Asian films are character-driven, while American films are plot-driven. L.A. Confidential has both great character studies and a wonderful plot. Add to this production values that are American films' forte, and you have a world-class masterpiece.One sour grapes note: To those who share my chagrin over L.A. Confidential's loss to the trash called Titanic, take comfort. In 1952, another mediocre spectacle film, Greatest Show on Earth, by a director with powerful backing, DeMille, beat out a future classic called High Noon, directed by a director of lesser "stature". James "I am king of the world!" Cameron vs Curtis Hanson. The parallels are striking.To me, its loss of the Oscar to Titanic reflects not on L. A. Confidential, but on the Academy. Actors are notoriously stupid. And since the Academy vote is dominated by actors, is it any wonder that the Oscar for Best Picture of 1997 was such a stupid award?
__label__1 E45 Errpr: I was taking great pictures then it went this error.I guess I will have to back to square one. I have discoveredthat many others have this problem.
__label__2 Great for storage!: I love this security bag, grated I only get into the bag once a month. I can only contest that it's a better bag, than your cheaper off-brand bags.
__label__1 Worst book I have ever suffered through.: This book was mind numbingly, painfully, tediously boring. Rambling, philosophical discussions,uninteresting back stories and dull lifeless characters all come together to create a book worthy of a burning. A true waste of print and page. The book doesn't deserve 1 star, but it was the least of my options. I flipped pages in this book faster than any other book I've read to date. All in the hope that at some point the boring stuff would end and I would find a story. It never happened.
__label__1 not for Vista: The web cam looks nice, but it does not work with Vista which is what I have, so here it sits.
__label__1 Zero Stars if it were possible!: When I pluged this unit into the wall it started crackling and poping inside. About 3 seconds later smoke started pouring out from within. I unpluged it, took it outside and watched it smoke for another 5 minutes or so. Thank god I didn't have anything pluged into it.
__label__1 So bad its...........well bad!: What can I say about this? If you like bad acting, losy songs and crappysets then this video is for you.enjoy!
__label__2 Excelent unexpected story. I will read it several times.: Kris Jensen pulls together a valid multicultural background of the main character, Sarah-half Navajo, and brings her into an alien world, not only as an observer but as a participant. Her personal diversity blends with the Ardel native attributes in her own unique way. The world of Ardel is also unique with people who reproduce in a triad and usually chance to fulfull all stages of that triad in a lifetime; people who communicate and operate through psychic abilities as well as speech and physical motion; Peaceful people who are triggered to warring between clans by the interference of profiteer humans. Not your usual sci-fi, this book leaves the reader with surprising conclusions and wanting more experiences from the planet Ardel.
__label__1 Anything I can't finish gets 1 star: Rather boring. I was excited about the story line but was dissapointed by the actual writing. All I remember about this book is "this person marries that person and gets some money. Then there is some battle and something about some mushrooms." For such a long book there is a surprising lack of detail or drama. I got within 50 pages of the end and ask myself "why bother?"
__label__1 Really hard way of finding the answers: I don't know how many times I thought to myself 'I don't remember learning it this way at all'. I have graduated HS about 15 years ago, and need to clept out of the math classes at college. I was recommended this book by my adviser. I became frustrated at how they came to their answers as I found it very complicated. I ended up going on You tube for some more tutorials and saw a much easier way of coming to the solution.
__label__2 Excellent product: Excellent product and I received quickly. I always will use this protective shooting because my vision is very clear and my shooting is nice. This seller is OK
__label__2 Great International Bossa Mix: This album is as charming as Cafe Apres Midi in Tokyo Japan. As I listen to this CD I think to myself that all Bossa Nova/Jazz/Lounge and Jazzanova fans would enjoy this as much as I did. The French, Portuguese and other laguages sung in this CD make you feel like you're traveling firts class through different countries. Great compilation.
__label__2 Incredible!!!: This is one of the best films I've ever seen! If you liked the sixth sense and other simular movies, you'll love this. Do not analyze it just sit back and enjoy. I knew Aston Kutcher was going to be a good actor; but after watching this, I can not think of any actor who could have done it better. The only word I could think of was incredible. If any critics knocked this movie then they need to get a new job, because they do not know what they are talking about.This is going on my personal altime best movies list.
__label__1 Just plain awful: Back in college I really enjoyed Blood, Sweat and Tear's Child is Father to the Man. It was my favorite album. I decided a few months ago to see what is going on with Al Kooper. I read the reviews on Black Coffee and bought it. My first Al Kooper album in 38 years. It was terrible. Probably the worst album I've every bought. I don't know what happened to ole Al but age hasn't been good to him.
__label__1 Everybody says it leaks...: So, it was a Gold Box special and refurbished, so I figured that they would have fixed the leak issue. It still leaks. I am very disappointed, but that's what I get for ignoring the reviews.
__label__1 1st Bad Amazon Purchase: I made a significant effort to get this instead of a cheaper look-alike. I bought two. One was a factory reject. The air valve is a disintegrating blob of white rubber or vinyl or whatever. Air can go in but cannot exit. Every attempt to adjust amount of inflation results in liquid rubber in the inflation pin making it useless. It seems only a matter of time before it can no longer keep air in the cushion and becomes a total waste of money. They is is the first and only disappointing Amazon purchase. And because we are continually traveling, a return or a claim is unviable. So we are quite screwed on this purchase. The OTHER Dyna Disc works fine but 1 out of 2 is unsatisfactory. Future Amazon purchases will certainly be affected by this bad deal.
__label__2 The Day the Thunderbird Cried: I read this book in one sitting; it was so riveting that I could not put it down. The book covers a variety of events during World War II but the main focus is on Dachau and its liberation by the 45th Thunderbird Division of the Seventh Army. New information about the liberation of Dachau debunks some of the previously published accounts and describes the heroism of the Thunderbird Division. At a time when Holocaust denial is rampant, this book tells the true story of the atrocities committed at Dachau. The author based his book on eye-witness accounts by American soldiers. There are also old black and white photos, never before published. This book should be required reading in every school in America.
__label__1 author's last name a spoiler in more ways than one: A "book" about Wagner and Aryan legend by someone named Levin. No need to read it to know it. And the cycle goes on and on. The choice of a Nordic being killed on the cover proves that the author is an anti-Nordite!
__label__2 Strong like an ox: I didn't really need a new can opener, but after having such great luck with other KitchenAid gadgets I figured I should complete my set. I'm very happy with this opener!KitchenAid seriously overbuilds all their equipment, and this can opener feels very strong in the hand. Almost no effort is needed to open cans. This is a solid piece of hardware.
__label__1 Don't Waste Your Money If You Have A Large Area To Protect!: I purchased this based on Amazon reviews. It works in theory but not practice. Its main downfall is the range that the sensors can communicate with the main keypad. Put a wall in the way and no joy. So unless you live in a one room apartment or only want to secure part of your living space - don't bother with this. The manufacturers support operation is pretty non existent. I have since gone with a used ADT system (without the monthly monitoring), a generic dialer and generic sensor that picks up the ADT chime sound.
__label__1 Mediocre Historical Mystery: I expected something more from than a bland (at best) mystery novel. Diana Gabaldon is a favorite of mine, and since I'm also a mystery fan I was thrilled that she was releasing a mystery. However, upon reading, this seems like a side project that she didn't devote her full attention to. The story is missing the passion and vivid characterization of her other books. The plot points moved along slowly, and while I do like Lord John, I found the majority of the characters confusing and bland. I didn't care what happened to any of them, really. There are much better mystery novels around, if you need a Diana Gabaldon fix I'd reread Outlander instead.
__label__2 Its been a while since I've used this: If I can remember correctly this did what it was suppose do. I just wish the ring tone volume could've been lowered and I paid $50 for this when it first came out. Now if I could only find something to allow my fax machine to work with one line.
__label__1 Like Pushing a Brick: Everything about this vacuum appears beautifully designed and built, until you try to push it across a carpet. Nearly every full size upright vacuum I've ever seen has four wheels to make it easy to push across a rug. This one on the other hand has two wheels in the back and the front of the vacuum just sits on the floor. Still not too bad until you turn it on and that terrific suction adheres the front of the vacuum to the carpet. It did a great job cleaning, but my arm was sore after doing half a room. There is no way that I could vacuum a whole house using this thing. We have dense pile carpet; perhaps there is less drag on a Berber or loop type carpet. It's a real shame, because I love the looks, quality of construction, and design of the hose and attachments, but bottom line: if I can't push it across the floor, all the great features in the world aren't going to make it an acceptable product.
__label__2 Get one NOW!: Amazon messed up my order and they're backordered until who knows when, but if you call Apple -- 1-800-692-7753 you can get one.
__label__2 Works as it should: Good product overall. Wanted to split video from my ten year old dell to my new hdtv. This did the job.
__label__1 Sorry I bought it: I have been to Corsica several times and wanted to buy a DVD that captured this island's beauty, but this DVD doesn't do this. First of all, it's like an amateur video that focuses most of the time in Ian Wright and not in the beautiful places that Corsica has to offer. Second, for someone who has never travel to Corsica it would offer no insight into the island. If I had the opportunity I would return it because we didn't even finish looking at it.On the other hand, I also bought and would much better recommend: Corsica: Ile de Beauté which gives you the images you expect in a travel video.
__label__1 Hungarian Folk : 50s-60s Style: In spite of the fetching picture of the Bulgarian ladies on the cover, this CD contains traditional Hungarian Folk music by the group Maros.The style tend more towards the restaurant-operetta rather than the later raw peasant-y emphasis of the Tanchaz movement of the 70s. Vocalists are backed by an orchestra that includes a cimbalom. Overall the songs are pleasantly produced and the vocals easily discernable. Songs include "Piros Kancso, Piros Bor", "Repulj Madar" and "Egy Szem Buza, Egy Szem Rosz" among others.
__label__1 First time Dean Koontz reader: This book was recommended to me by a co-worker and, while I found the first 80 pages horrific but captivating, the rest of the novel lacked creativity and I found myself reading on only to see what implausible thing Chyna would do next. Dean Koontz will not make my reading list again.
__label__1 A Little Flat: I am usually a huge Nora Roberts fan, but this one fell a little flat. I appreciate an author who has a talent for descriptive writing, and can make you almost "feel" the setting of the book. That is one of my favorite things about Nora Roberts. However, has anyone else besides me noticed that many sentences in the book start with the word "and"? It's starting to drive me crazy! Enough already!!
__label__1 only OK: I enjoyed the story, although I think Mr Coonts has been going down hill since the first 4 Jake Grafton novels.The story was contrived, and continuity was poor - little things like didn't we have some uprising in Cuba during "Under seige" (probably where we should have left Jake, Toad and the gang)In a real world situation should an Admiral not be back at the Carriers CIC during the fighting - where he can keep an eye on the whole battle?To sum up, fans of the Grafton series will enjoy the book, but you you do need to read thru a fair bit of the "yeah right" bits.
__label__2 it's korn. do you really need more information?: This is a classic. Almost all the songs are good on here, with the exception of "porno creep" and "low rider" which i don't really understand the point of. oh well. small price to pay when there are 12 more tracks that kick ... . This cd goes very well with their self titled debut. worth every penny
__label__2 All Naesmyth descendants should appreciate this book!: Although Amazon.com has the wrong name for the author (should be John W. NesSmith, not Naesmyth), this book is a true jewel. Written/compiled by a man with a true passion for digging through the archives and emerging with some great information. If you're a Naesmyth descendant (as I am) and especially if you're of the "Georgia" Line (which I'm not), you'll enjoy and treasure this book as a valuable resource and heirloom. This large, hardbound book has family tree listings for thousands of Naesmyth descendants. <...>
__label__2 Nice Book.: My little ones, one and two keep asking if that is elmo's mom, which they dont illustrate her face. Otherwise they like the book.
__label__2 love it loved it loved it: it was like graham was reading it to me! he writes exactly how he talks and i absolutely loved this book. it is so well written and really interesting. i did not want it to finish!!!!
__label__1 Show me the money: The author's conclusion that the Korean War and subsequent security alliance was purely economic from the U.S. standpoint. This ought to be easy to prove using pure numbers. In his 288 pages of diatribes, the author never once shows us 1. How much money is spent on the defense of Korea every year 2. How much economic benefit the U.S. gains from Korea in foreign mililitary sales and trade. Even if he could not prove that in 1953 there were leaders in the U.S. government who could predict the conditions that would exist in the future, it would lend some credibility to his weak theory. In a book such as this, the numbers need to support the conclusion.
__label__2 This album is great, but....: I love Nsync's new album! This even has two new songs on it. This CD is good if you want the bonus tracks on the same CD as the other songs. However, you can find "Falling" and "That Girl" on the recently released soundtrack "On the Line", the movie that Lance and Joey are in. That is why these two songs didn't make it on the US album. In addition, the OTL soundtrack has Briney, BBMak, a solo by Joey, and other good songs. I highly recommend it. But if you don't want to pay more money for a whole new CD and just want Nsync songs, this would be a good buy. The bonus tracks are worth the extra money, and makes the CD a little longer.
__label__1 Better than a sleeping pill.: Here's a quarter for the clue phone, McGuireN from New York City, It's BORING!
__label__2 good, not great: One theme is constant throughout the book: association. You relate what you are trying to remember to something in the real world or between objects if you are trying to memorize a list. Helpful, yes, but I felt as though some chapters could have been much shorter or thrown out altogether with this concept running throughout the first 90 pages.
__label__1 Save Your Money!: I bought this book because of the good reviews it received. Most of the recipes are simply things I would never cook...maybe because I'm a "southern cook". Things like "Rigatoni alla Calabria", "Mussels Steamed in White Sauce", and "Asparagus in Orange Sauce" are recipes I would never try. I LOVE cookbooks, trying new recipes, but this is a cookbook I will probably NEVER use. I was very disappointed. Phyllis
__label__2 A quality assemblage of extras for a great movie: Young Frankenstein is a classic. A must-see for comedy fans. The DVD format yeilds two distinct advantages: awesome video quality, and extra content. The georgeous black and white feel of the movie really comes through on DVD. Crisp, clear, with excellent contrast. The extra content is icing on the cake. There are deleted scenes, which clear up many of the unanswered questions from the movie. There is a wonderful 36 minute documentary on the making of the movie. There are several trailers and some interviews with the stars. And there are numerous bloopers.The only thing that isn't in it (and I wish it was)is a director's commentary. Commentary from Mel Brooks would likely be as funny as the movie itself.
__label__2 A-M-A-Z-I-N-G: awesome. great. so incredibly informative. it really does a good job at showing you exactly why wal-mart should be taken down. anyone who watches this and does NOT realize how evil that company is and how unbelievably immoral their actions are, is absolutely insane. WATCH THIS MOVIE.
__label__2 Great show: This is a wonderful medical drama.I just ordered this show from Amazon, and want to say one thing regarding the double sided DVDs. It's true that they don't say side A or B. However, it's fairly easy to determine which is which. Side A, which is facing up when you open the case, has a green ring around the inside edge. It also says "additional content on the opposite side of disc" in small letters. The reverse side has no writing or coloring on it. So, that should clear up the double sided disc confusion.
__label__1 Pick a different book: This was the assigned text for a short section on electrophysiology in my first year graduate neuroscience course. I did not have a math or electronics background, but had worked in a neurophys lab for two years. I managed to learn stuff from this book, but it was hard work and I couldn't have done it without my lecturer and classmates. It's obvious that the authors really know their stuff, but being able to explain it to novices is another thing... And I agree with the other reviewer who noted that the index is *completely* useless, almost random lists of page numbers after topics...Unless you have to buy this book for a class, skip it (and if it is the text for a course, ask your instructor why!!)- buy Molecular and Cellular Physiology of Neurons by Fain instead, it doesn't cover as many topics, but breadth is no use if you can't understand the content. My department switched to the Fain text last year because so many people complained about Johnston et al.
__label__2 neat idea: these are great propped up in my son's crib. it gives him something to look at when he's hangin out in there. the cards are thick and quality material, as is the box they come in. i'm really happy with them, they're cute, quality and functional! great value at this price.
__label__1 NOT OEM: Discription said OEM but turned out to be a cheap non-OEM product. Fell apart about a week after I got it.
__label__1 Trouble loves him; please phone home Johnny Marr!!: In his 7th solo since dissolving The Smiths, Moz has hit an all-time low. The only track worth listening to in this collection is the poignant "Trouble Loves Me", a ballad reminiscent of his early days with Johnny Marr. Similar to Elton John without Bernie, Morrissey is lost without the music Marr used to provide him; yet he continues to issue record upon record of dull, dreary, tuneless songs until you want to scream "Release your (huge) ego and call up Johnny" - while we're still young.
__label__1 this product not what it used to be: I bought this product for the first time two years ago and they were great. I re-ordered recently and was very disappointed. I never review products. If they are bad I just suck it up. But just had to say how bad this product had become. Shorts are very oversized. Fit as if they were four years old. I will not buy again.
__label__2 terrific ABC book: My daughter (almost 2 years old) adores this book! We borrowed it from our library and it quickly became a part of her bedtime routine. It is simple with not a lot of overwhelming colors, patterns, shapes, etc. Just the alphabet and some cute dogs. It has helped us in teaching her to pronunciate her letters. I had to add it to her Amazon wish list because I'm not sure we can give it back to the library? lolI definitely recommend this as a great ABC board book!
__label__2 Zatoichi #5: I really appreciate Home Vision Entertainments production of the Zatoichi movie series. Each release has been an excellent presentation of Zatoichi. As a Japenese Samurai Movie fan I think that this series of DVD's is the best. The character of Zatoichi is very compelling and each story helps you identify with this Blind Swordsman who is always trying to do good for others. The examples of Japenese culture during this time period is very beautiful and detailed. Shintaro Katsu displays a wide range of emotions as Zatoichi and his display of swordmanship is excellent.
__label__1 They're ok for kids: I'm a boxing trainer and also a fighter, these mitts do not have a lot of padding. Which is why I only use them when teaching my kids' boxing class. When I take any of my amateur fighters on them, they just spew small pieces of foam all over my clothes and the ring. I would not reccomend these for anyone who is training adults, they won't hold up and you will definitely feel numb after holding them for a heavy hitter, arthritis and carpal tunnel will sneak up on you faster than Mayweather's jab.
__label__1 FILTH AND PERVERSION: I CANNOT BELIEVE THIS BOOK WAS REQUIRED SUMMER READING FOR MY 9TH GRADER GOING TO 10TH GRADE.

__label__1 annoying: Ad blurbs for this book should advise readers to read the first two "Emma" books before reading this one. I have read most of the Jury books, but I was not aware that there were any Emma books until I struggled with this third one. Thus I hardly knew what was going on half the time or what was being referred to in this book. And what was the outcome? It's very annoying to read an entire book in this genre only to be left hanging as to the resolution of the plot. Grimes is not on the level of "Turn of the Screw"; she should give the reader the answers.
__label__1 We preferred Rick Steve's: After our first week in Paris, we left all the other guide books, including this one behind at the hotel and kept our Rick Steve's guide. Sorry Michelin, he's got you beat.
__label__1 Awful: Must be my taste buds as other reviews says it's great. I think it is awful but my dog ate it. I do see one review that says mom doctors it up with sour cream. Might improve it. If this is better than Annie's, I would hate to taste Annie's.
__label__1 Exciting?: I borrowed this ebook from the library thinking it had action, adventure and two lovers finding their way back to each other. Maybe the book just starts slow but I got to page 117 and the only action is Merlyn faking his death.Ysabella goes on and on, repeatedly, about how terrible Merlyn is, how he tricked her. Her reason for leaving him revolves around how pious she is but she makes the most of her reputation as a witch. At this point in the book she is not a very likable character and I can't bring myself to listen or read more.I think I could really like Merlyn for all that he is a deceitful devil. I want to know more about his side of things instead of the constant harping from her.The action has to increase as the plot moves on but waiting well over a third of the book is too long for me.
__label__1 Boring Bathos: If I wanted to watch a soap opera, I would watch a soap opera. 43 minutes of my life I will never get back, not to mention $1.99. This must be part of the reason they fired Frank Darabont, the saving money part. This must've been shot for 20k, since there is only a single, cameo appearance by a zombie and the rest is just shallow blah blah blah without any insight. And the entire zombie in the well sequence was just plain stupid. What a disappointment this show is becoming.
__label__1 Auto manual is a lemon!: I recently bought this Chilton manual for my 2000 Honda Accord, and "disappointed" is an understatement. The manual was entirely generic procedures supplemented by poor quality photos and factory drawings. Worse, in two places where I have done the procedures in the past, the manual was flat out wrong. In one case, the procedure described to retract the disk brake calipers would actually damage the caliper if used. I returned the manual, and strongly recommend you stay away from the Chilton series. Hayes is better.
__label__1 JUNK: waste of money poorly bulit, had to send the first on back because the battery would not charge,cost me $17.00 to send it back to shipper,second on does not work ratteling inside,junk from China.
__label__1 ummmmmmm.....not that good: for some reason,i did not like this movie.the only part i liked was the part where van damme was tied ip to the cross and then he kicks it down.this movie,i thought was darker and gloomier than most other van damme movies,and thats part of the reason that i didn't like it.overall boring,and didn't keep my attention
__label__2 Nice to know I am not the only one...: wow this book hit the nail on the head. I am going to pass it to my sister for her to read. I don't think my other Protestant friends would get it. Truly for all the Catholic girls out there.
__label__1 Ordered but Not Received: To date I have not received this book and so cannot rate the product.Since it was intended as a gift I am disappointed that I have not received it nor given it to the person it was intended for. I had to place a rating because I could not submit the review without doing so. The rating is undeserved.
__label__2 Scholarly yet very readable.: Gwyn Morgan gives life to ancient texts and really shows what happened in 69 A.D. This book is must reading for students of ancient history.
__label__1 Very slow drops thru the filter: The water thru the filter was dripping in drops eventhough we have a very good speed of water flow thru the faucet.
__label__1 Buckeye Spirit? Looks Gross to Me: I bought this video expecting to see some sweet Buckeye tailgate tradition, but the only thing on the tape was a bunch of guys in Ohio State jerseys making out with one another while Seal's "Kiss From a Rose" played softly in the background. It went on for almost two hours. Quite disturbing.My advice? Save the $16, go to a greater Columbus-area pub, and buy four appletinis. In the time it takes you to sip down a few of Ohio's favorite alcoholic beverage, you'll see plenty more guys in Ohio State jerseys making out with one another, and you'll get a nice buzz.The video is accurate, just lacks creativity. If you're into this sort of thing, go for it. GO BUCKS!
__label__2 Amazing!: Amazing movie! Jennifer Lawrence is an amazing actress. I would ever get rid of this move. I have watched it 5 times already. If you havent read the books, read them!
__label__1 Forgot to describe the action: I have read,and bought all of the series. I was disappointed, when comparing with the others in the series. Much time is spent in describing minute details, but when it comes to action, such as the battle at the taking of the shore installation, it is all condensed into a few paragraphs. It is as if including the battle was an afterthought. Because it is a continuation of the series, it is worth reading, but is disappointing.
__label__1 I would give it no stars: SHALLOW! I can not believe this is a best seller. It makes me sad to think so many people find this book good.
__label__1 Wrong info: You have eleven seasons, but Fishborne was only in 3, William Petersen was in 8 of them, and better that Fishborne. You need to get your correct info before submitting it.
__label__2 joyce seebaum: Cute movie with no cussing or sex in it. Good for all ages. More movies should be made like this one.
__label__2 imo: "dehumanizing fishbowl view"hard to think of anything else but what war on earth is, unlike some posters i have a fishtank and happen to know what the .mil does to humans.have some bowls or brews, watch and listen.peace.
__label__1 Awful: I downloaded the first four Don Brown books in this series for free for the Kindle, read Treason and then deleted them all since Treason was so terrible.I then became curious because of all the five star reviews of the other books in the series so I skimmed through the deleted copies on my Kindle (on a Kindle you never really delete anything, it just goes into your archive which is similar to the Windows trash can) to see if they were any different. Unfortunately they are all the same tediously boring, unimaginative drivel as Treason.I don't know what is going on with all these 5 star reviews but it seems very odd that a large percentage of them seem to be from reviewers where this is their only Amazon review. As Alice once said, "curiouser and curiouser."
__label__2 Can't beat the price.....: Good sound for the price, clear mid range and highs, but don't expect any bass out of these...
__label__2 for Nilsa: Bought this book at for my sister-in-law who's husband was facing federal prosecution and she wanted to read it. Hope it was helpful to her.
__label__2 Baby Bible Storybook: The book is terrific and so was the service. However, for such a small book, the price seems high to me. This was the going price but I still thought it was too much.
__label__1 Product not as described: This Makita p/n, 792466-5, described in Amazon listing as 14TPI, 5-pack, will get you a 18TPI 5-pack. But scroll down to the "Technical Details" - says 14TPI. Then on down to Product Description - 18TPI, that's what you get. But if you wanted a similar package in 18TPI, go to Makita 792467-3. It says 18TPI in the Amazon listing, 18TPI in Technical details, and 12TPI in Product Description. Just don't trust the numbers - it's a shell game.
__label__2 Preconceived: I think this is a great book, however, it has alot of unanswered questions (as far as I'm concerned). Some parts I think could've been more detailed, especially the issue with her sister and the situation she was dealing with.Oh...the first love scene with you no who if you read the book was great. I was laughing and wishing, saying to myself DAMN.... Wishing it was me....Over-all it's a great book...Robyn Williams has excellent writing skills.
__label__1 this is not writing its typing: wouldnt bother to pass it on to friends threw it in the trash.how he ever got this publish is beyond me.
__label__2 Marvel's big guns...: DC comics has had it's days with the Superman & Batman movies. Now finally, Marvel brings out it's big guns with Spiderman. Oh sure, "Xmen" was a good effort. And so was "Blade" (with its sequel due in March). But Spidey is Marvel's golden boy. Like Superman & Batman, kids are BORN knowing who Spiderman is. It's going to be "Batmania" all over again. As an adult, I tend to be more cautious when it comes to movies like this one. When all you see is the eye-candy effects and no sight of a real story. I hope to Stan Lee that I'm wrong and we actually get a great plot as well as great effects & action. Probably won't, though. Spiderman will be a hit, regardless. With all of the factors the other reviewers mentioned such as the actors, director, & effects, it will definitely give Star Wars: Episode II some serious competition. Plus we get the infamous Danny ... Elfman supplying the score. Spiderman won't be great, but it will be (darn) good!!
__label__2 Artwork is beautful: The story I appreciate and understand but dosen't really hold my interest. I'm probably too old (I'm 58). But the drawings in the animation are incredible. It's like each frame could hang on your wall as an artwork. The lighting and shadows, the night scenes, the snow falling are just unbelievable. That is enough for me to really like this anime. It is a very quiet slow moving story with very subdude music. The music is what I would describe as haunting. One of the most beautifully done animes I've seen. It's worth a buy. I'm sure I'll watch it many more times.
__label__2 ConnREVIEWER: Love this little vac! Very powerful suction and holds a charge very well. I have recommended it to all my friends, bought one for my daughter and one for the office.
__label__1 A strange approach...: This is an odd book, written as part open letter to the late Michael Jackson and part history of the life and career of Jackson and the other members of the Jackson family, up until the mid-80s. Interestingly, there is a fair amount of judgement and insinuation going on here (and this was before Michael's life got completely out of control), so it is far from an objective journalistic book. The author seems to be primarily annoyed at MJ's unwillingness (in his opinion) to take risks and expose himself emotionally, either in his music or his personal life, but the writer's smug condescension makes it difficult to take his critique seriously.
__label__2 I swear by this: I really do swear by this moisturiser. It's absorbes easily into the skin and is not greasy at all. It doesn't have a smell, if that is what you prefer, and it lasts forever. I use this day and night. And for the price you can't go wrong. Very pleased.
__label__1 NO CC FOR HEARING IMPAIRED: WHY WOULD A 1980 MOVIE NOT HAVE CLOSED CAPTION? GREAT CASTAND SUBJECT BUT JUST LOOKING AT IT ISN'T THE SAME.HOW DISAPPOINTING.
__label__1 You Call This Music?: This was one of the worst attempts at music I have ever heard! She sounds like a sick cat with extremely low self esteem caterwauling at the moon!
__label__1 Leaks, leaks, leaks: We bought these because we liked the safety of the double-zipper. But it doesn't do much good when the bags leak. 10%-20% of the time the bags leak when you defrost. Why take that risk with your "liquid gold".
__label__2 Definitive & His Crowning Achievement: This is the late Mr Peterson's best book and his most beautiful. The information supplied here is exhaustive. The paintings are worth the price of admission alone. Each picture is beautiful and so full of detail that even photographers might have a difficult time duplicating them. Also, the paintings serve as better illustration of field marks than photography. This is a grand book for the beginning birder and experienced birder alike. *****
__label__2 Works Good: The product works well cleaning up after our puppy. We use it on our wood floors and carpet. We like it and will order it again.
__label__2 Good protection for small items: This case fits small devices, like digital voice recorders and possibly ipod nano. It provides holes for headphones, etc., but does not allow access to the screen or buttons.
__label__1 Disappointing!: I'd ordered Parenting Early Years, got couple of issues and they were ok. Then I've decided to subscribe for Parenting school years either. Today I got my first August!!!! issue... I've already had my September issue of Early Years for 3 weeks now. And I am also really disappointed with the content because it duplicates Early Years' issue completely, except advertisements. I don't get the publisher's idea to print one content with two different covers and distribute this as two different magazines.
__label__2 Best!!!: This book is by far the best book I have ever read, and that is saying a lot.I have read it more than 10 times over, and I know that I will keep on reading it over and over again till the pages disintegrate. I made sure to have more than one copy, just incase they go out of print.
__label__2 This book is AWESOME: If you like horses this book is for you. The basic plot:-after a shipwreck, a kid ends up stranded on an island with a horse-the two befriend each other and help each other (kid feeds horse, horse kills snake near kid)-the two our found and taken back to NY, where the kid lives-all are happy to see the kid's alive-the horse has amazing talent in the field of racing, but the kid has no papers for the horse so he is unable to race it-they find a race that was set up by the owners of the horses and ask the owners if he can be entered into it-they say yesThe book ends with a thrilling race that you feel you are riding in.
__label__2 7 Steps to Living at Your Full Potential: Pastor Joel Osteen has really captured the essence of a life-fulfilled. I have listened to Tony Robbins' tapes over and over again trying to memorize what the key ingredients are to living my life to its full potential. However, Joel Osteen has gone one step farther in relating how God wants us to live our lives, and Osteen gives us the optimism to want to go out and truly experience the life that the Lord has in mind for us. It is a "no excuse" mission that we are given. I have listened to Osteen's tapes of the book, but they certainly didn't capture the essence of his philosophy like the book does. I have devoured every word. Thank you, Osteen!Jeanne RamageEducational TherapistNorthridge, California
__label__1 Bad Deal: Braun KF580-BK AromaDeluxe 10-Cup TimeControl Coffeemaker, BlackWatch Sellers return policy / bought this coffee maker from Electronics/ worked for 3 mo. and will not work now, notified seller only to be told I had to have all original packaging in order to return for exchange & of course I am not in the habit of storing all packaging when I purchase an item.I am out the money and the store got rid of a faulty coffee maker,I would say a pretty good DEAL for them not ME. macer46
__label__1 Better for speaker switching than source switching: Like another reviewer indicated, this is not a true source isolating switch - it is designed more for swapping sets of speakers than it is for sources. The ground is shared. Instructions are pretty weak - you can go to Dayton's website and see the one-page instruction sheet that comes with the unit - be very careful to make sure you have all your inputs & outputs correct before turning everything on. The mechanics of this switch (i.e.- shared ground) makes me very nervous.
__label__1 disappointing: This is a very amatuerish DVD, in which many still photos are displayed repetitiously.The narration is clearly totally impromptu - not planned or arranged in any orderly manner.It's not very helpful in understanding the subject at all.
__label__1 let down: I really had high expectations with this since it was from Universal I've always had good results from there products but I got nothing from this not even a lil pump or even a flush feeling......sorry Universal but guess I'll stay with Hemo Rage
__label__1 Great idea- terribly made: Great idea and the castle is great- but the dolls are horrible. Arms and hair fall off every two minutes. Wish they would replace them with working dolls. Not worth the money since my daughter will only use winx dolls with the castle and they keep falling apart.
__label__2 The best way to learn Old English: If you wish to learn Old English either on your own or in a class, this book enables you to do so. It assumes no knowledge of Latin or any other foreign language, and it provides a full review of grammar for learners who are not familiar with standard grammatical terminology. The website for the book offers access to homework exercises as well as audio files of Old English texts.
__label__1 Never buy ONKYO: After 1 year my ONKYO DV-CP500 will not even open the tray. This will be the last ONKYO product that I ever buy. PLEASE avoid this product at all cost, it sucks.
__label__2 EXCELLENT..but problems at first: I first had problems with this....but once it forced Windows to shut down and I sent the error to Microsoft..they sent me to the Roxio website where I downloaded a patch and now it operates FLAWLESSLY! I'm running Windows XP on a 2.5 Ghz system...700MB memory. I'm VERY happy with it.
__label__2 Very Good Paper...: This paper works wonderfully in my printer (a Canon I860). This is no wrinkly lightweight paper that feels cheap to the touch. The ink on the printed page looks crisp and even on this smooth, heavyweight paper. Gives a very professional appearance. I'll probably buy this paper again from Amazon rather than trudge down to Office *** or Staples to buy the bargain stuff.
__label__1 Pretty but lame: This unit performs well while it lasts, but mine only lasted a few months when using with care. I do not jog. The unit stayed in my car the whole time. It just stopped working.
__label__1 boring!!!!!!: I hoped that this game was fun, seeing on all the reviews and stuff, but it's not. This game needs like this expansion, to make it more,supposedly fun, don't buy it!
__label__2 Excellent but Lacks Apologetic Tactics: The book is a wonderful, comprehensive analysis of the prevailing naturalist worldview present in North America. From what I understand this view is even more pervasive in Europe. The repetition of Creation, Fall, and Redemption drives home the basis for which we should evaluate and view our culture.The book is extensive and thus, quite lengthy. Various real-life stories are included throughout that help the book from becoming too dry.The only thing missing are solid methods of shooting down the logical fallacies committed by those who hold such naturalist worldviews. This is understandable considering the weight of the book. There are numerous other resources available for such study.All in all, this book should be a must-read for real Christians and Non-Christians as well.
__label__2 Sexy but.......................: I bought these shoes in black. They are very sexy, but the toe part very tight. I had to take them off because my big toe was dying. I am hoping that if I wear them a couple more times that part will loosen up a bit.
__label__2 Fat Kid Rules the World: "Would it be funny if the Fat Kid got splattered by a subway train?" Those are the thoughts of Troy Billings, a depressed, suicidal, overweight teen who meets Curt McRae, a homeless teen who lives in the New York subway when he's not performing in underground music concerts. Troy become Curt's drummer, where they go onto change their lives and the music world altogether.My favorite is when Troy's dad, an ex-marine, smuggles Curt out of the hospital so that he can get to the show he's supposed to be performing in.The message of this book is that everyone has their own place in the world that will make them feel like they have a purpose in life.This is a book is a good book. It really showed the influence music can have on people. It's also nice that you don't need any prior understanding to get it. Because of that, this book is good for all audiences.
__label__1 Um............"overkill?": If we, the Stones' fans, haven't kept this...uh..."memoribilia," we sure ain't going to recycle now. The "Exile" cards are worth something...so what? The music is worth more than the silly entrapments. Betcha the Stones themselves had naught to do with this.
__label__2 page turner: I'm an 18 year old high shcool graduate who hated reading books. My friend bought me this book and begged me to read it. So, i agreed just so i could get him to shut up, but to my surprise i ended up not being able to put the book down. Now i want to read all of Alex Garland's books. I definitely recommend reading this book!
__label__2 Buffalo Valley: I was very pleased with the condition of this item. I have never ordered used books online before but I figured what would it hurt because they were for my mother and my mother buys all of her books at book sales and garage sales. If all of the used books I order are in this condition I will definitely keep getting them this way. Thanks!
__label__2 Thumb Fan!: I am a huge Oedekerk fan! He is my favorite Actor/Writer/Director/Producer. I have seen all six of the thumb movies. This one I liked the most. It made the stupid things in the original and made it into a funny movie. I can't wait until Thumbatrix, The Lord of Thumb Rings, Jaws Thumb, The Thumbinator, and any other thumb movies come out soon.
__label__1 Made things worse!: My 6 week old was having gas issues and spitting up a bit so we decided after reading the reviews on here to try Dr. Brown's. What a waste of time, money, and laundry detergent! For 3 days I tried these bottles and for 3 days he burped more and spit up MORE. We had to change his crib sheet 3 times in one day and his clothes and mine 4 times in one day all because he spit up a large amount of formula. So back to Avent for our little guy.NOTE: It has now been over a month since switching back to Avent and our little guy is doing MUCH better. Sure he still spits up some but nothing like he did with the Dr. Brown's bottles.
__label__2 Promising debut: This the first studio album from lene marlin, it had a main single which was "sitting down here" and in the uk it done reasonably well. The album did recieve quite alot of good press but was never a big seller out of her own country of Norway.Most of this album has alot of gentle songs, guitar and soft beat driven. It has some more up-beat songs aswell, with some light electric guitar influence. Definately an album to invest in, may not grab you at first but is a definate grower, in my opinion the best albums are the ones you don't get too bored with easily after a few listens, and this is one of them.
__label__2 good but not special: I have used swing-a-way brand openers for 30 years and they haven't changed a bit. This product is similar but slightly better, I think because of sharper blades. Like many oxo products it is overpriced but if you forget that you will like it for a long whileOne off for price
__label__2 The Essence Of Good World Music: Rasa's Devotion is as strong a debut as one could hope for; if you enjoy traditional middle eastern music but with a modern twist, then Devotion is the album for you.The instrumentation is stellar, but not clinical -- the musicians know how to let real life breathe through each number, and Rasa member Hans Christian's arrangements and productions are top notch. But the real centerpiece here that takes these traditional tracks to another place is the mesmorizing voice of Kim Waters. She sings in such a breathy, sensual way that one cannot help but stop and listen. Her voice is trancendent and goes down like honey dripping over your soul.The whole album makes for a great relaxing experience, but standouts include Bhajahu Re Mana, Arati, and Ganesha Sharanam. If these tunes fail to move you something is wrong.
__label__2 Good, but not for large heads: I bought this hard hat for a costume, and I had to cut the inner straps just to fit my head inside. (Note: Do NOT cut/alter the inside if you are using this as actual head protection) I can't speak to its protective ability, but don't buy this product if you have an exceptionally large head like me. My head is 25 in./63.5 cm in circumference.
__label__2 One of the best movies ever!: I too, like others here wonder where is the whole series in a box set? I saw this movie first as a teenager and loved it-and have to wait for them to be on late night movies to catch one! The Thin Man series is one of the best sequel movies ever made, not like the ones today that you groan when you hear that there is a sequel!!! Top rate film and acting!
__label__2 Give this game a chance, it's better than you think.: I purchased this game because I am a Wipeout fan. I enjoyed the first, the second was great, but my first reaction to the third was less than enthusiastic. I was looking for another XL. The soundtrack is just as good as XL if not better, especially song #14. The sound effects aren't as good and the weapons seems less impressive. BUT, after I played this game more and more I began to enjoy it. The tracks are much smoother than any other Wipeout game and some of the extra features really have some cool things to do. I listen to the music all the time, and I am still trying to master the rapier class tracks. Enjoy this game, if you have the heart for it and the speed in your fingers, you will like it. Overall, a great sequel. Can't wait to see what PS2 will provide.
__label__1 Ambivalent: I echo Artic Fox's review. I'd just read "The Mercy of Thin Air" - also narrated by a dead person - and truly a haunting, moving book. It was clear from the beginning that "Death of An Ordinary Man" had a different agenda.It was good enough for me to keep reading it, but only a chapter at a time. The narrative style - while certainly introspective and thought provoking (assuming you are terrifically moved by the book) - was rambling, and I skimmed places. Then I'd have to go back and read it because suddenly I'd be like, "Whaaaaa?"It didn't really move me, but it was well written for that style. If you really dig the first few chapters, you'll love the book. If you find yourself iffy on it, or bored - you might as well put it down because I doubt it will grab you when you get further in.
__label__1 Cruising the British Virgin Islands: While it contains "some" useful information, the overall quality of this product, both from an information and video quality persepctive is poor. The video looks like something that was transfered from someone's home movies and reminds me of the old super 8 home movies I saw when I was a child. The intent of the product has some significant potential but it is lost in the overall quality of the presentation.
__label__1 Big Fella Gets Worse With Age: This release from Seattles' dead horse beaters "Easy Big Fella" is more of the unremarkable material that has been the standard since the original line-up fell apart after their first cd release. With the departure of songwriter Steve Mandl and horn master Colin Shroy, Easy Big Fella have lost whatever it was that made them such a great Seattle secret. With their first album out of print, any of their other releases are a poor example of what was once a really great band.
__label__2 Ok Fountain: When I first got this fountain I thought it was great. But, cleanig is a pain in the rear. There are alot of parts to take apart. The dome design is interesting. And the fountain is fairly quiet. You will have to read and SAVE the instructions for assembly and cleaning.My cats like the fountain ok. They played in it at first. One month later and my cats aren't really interested in the fountain. They hold out for a drink from the sink. Naughty babies!Four months later and I'm tired of taking the silly thing apart to clean it. I bought the drinkwell fountain instead. It's quiet and easy schmeezy to assemble and to clean. Hope it holds up.
__label__2 Some great, some less: This album is a collection of the earlier works of the magnificent Japanese rock group Mr Children. Especially tracks 4,6,7 and 11 stand out as being truly amazing, whilst the other songs admittedly have a certain attraction to them, although not as great. Overall this album offers a lot to fans of Mr CHildren, yet if you are a new fan, never yet having heard this band, i would advise a different album, perhaps Its A Wonderful World, Bolero, or Discovery. As a foreigner, i can honestly say that not understanding the lyrics only enhances the music and is of no importance, as the fusion of a wide range of instruments works majestically and is a great listen for everyone. Enjoy the album!
__label__1 Missing parts toy sized dog crawls out: It looks fine and is priced fine, but I had to return the first one to amazon because it was missing the parts bag. I also then found that it only to my toy sized puppy about 3 minutes to figure out how to crawl out the corner. WARNING: the entire cage can fold in pretty easy, which led to it falling over and breaking the dog's leg. - TRUE STORY. I can not recommend this product.
__label__1 I'll Keep it short...IT LEAKS: Yep, all reviews are true, should have read before purchasing..... Leaks Coffee from the bottom after a few months of use. Don't be fooled by good looks and stay away from this junker!!
__label__1 a good system with some major flaws: i got mine from a friend so i didn't get any speakers or remote but with the 6 speakers i have it works well accept I cant have the volume over 17 without it turning itself off.about the sub problem i agree they most likely forgot to change a setting but if you think you've done everything right (right settings, right calls to costomer support ect.) and it still doesn't work; deal with it or return it.but overall i think its a good machine (that needs to be able to use its full potential).
__label__1 Disappointed.: The color and sound was alright but I was rather disappointed in the movie itself. It was a very short movie with no introduction starting with the movie and it was a race alright but the driver and car were a total disaster in the ending part of the movie. I would not class this movie as a 1st Class movie by a long ways. I guess I was expecting a much better auto race than was in the movie. Maybe others will enjoy it but I felt it was a waste of my money personnally!!!
__label__2 Best loppers I've ever owned: I do a lot of gardening and I've owned a lot of loppers. These are the first that I've been totally pleased with. They are super sharp and will easily cut branches up to 2 inches in diameter. I also like the way the blades are designed and the way they "grip" the branch. I've been using them for 6 months now and I've never noticed them getting stuck inside a cut. They really make your work a lot easier and even pleasurable.
__label__1 Worst Soccer Game Ever!!: I have owned most soccer games that have come out, anmd this is by far the worst. It just is not fun. Atari soccer in 1977 was better. The Dreamcast is more exciting off than with the game going. I do not understand how the great game of 'calcio' can be made to be so unentertaining. Stay away from the MLS Gamenight also, for you have no control of the shot, and every shot goes high or wide, plus both games do not feature real players. Stick with FIFA. Games this bad cause hooliganism!
__label__2 A marvel!: I found this recording in the original LP version in an used books store. This LP was New, and closed, in mint condition. Original from 1978. And wow! Was very very good recorded, and the music is very good performed and beautifuly executed, intimate. I love this recording as much as I can.
__label__1 No DRM for me thank you very much: This game is neat and all but I returned it after finding out that it installed DRM on my computer. From now on, I will be researching PC games I buy and if it has a DRM like this one on it, I'm not buying it.
__label__1 Gore gore gore and oh, did i mention gore?: This movie is one that I will never forget. It was originally made in New Zealand under the name of "Brain Dead." It is full of bad acting, cheezy gore, and dead zombie babies. Rent it first to see if it is your "type," then buy it here.
__label__1 Hemlock Bay: Having read other books by Coulter, I looked forwqard to this, BUT was greatly disappointed. It was unbelievable..even as science fiction (which it should have been touted as). There wasn't any resolution, the characters did not ring true, and the F.B.I. depictions were unrealistic and oversimplified. In case you haven't guessed nt now, i thought this book was awful..and a waste of my time and money.
__label__1 Cursed is right...: if you watched this movie. A werewolf is on the loose in Los Angeles and attacks siblings Ellie (Ricci) and Jimmy (Eisenberg). They are now "cursed" and the only way to break it is to kill the person who started everything. This movie did not have a lot of thrills in it and they tried a little humor as well, which did not work too well if you ask me. Sadly, I would have to say pass on this movie.
__label__1 Its depend on your perception: This is the game where every person will have different opinion. If you like this type of game, you'll like it so much. If you hate it, you'll hate it so much. I'm in the second category. Some people like this game but not me. For me, this just 5 stage short arcade game. And the worst is, everytime you lose in the boss battle (every stage) you have to repeat it's 5 minutes boring stage again and again. Better try before you buy. Yes, I think this game is overated (because of Sega name, maybe?)
__label__1 Rambling Consumerist Babble: I had high hopes for this book. The notion of a uniting, core drive is appealing. But after reading halfway, it is revealing it's true colors as a rambling hodge-podge of mutually contradictory theories without coherence or concrete action plan.The main "meat" section is strictly designed for business selling. No plan is provided for home telesales. Later chapters feature high school psychology concepts along with cut/paste Internet newsclippings etc.
__label__2 The starting point of Ortega's philosophy: The great Spanish philosopher Ortega y Gasset left many followers, some of them also important thinkers, like Julian Marias. But most are common people who became much more educated and civilized persons by reading his wonderful books. Ortega was one of the rare species of philosophers who expresse his ideas in a very clear prose. Others in this line are Plato and Augustine, or Bertrand Russell, an Ortega contemporary. Meditations on Quixote is a small book where the master strives to give a synthesis of his thought. A synthesis of this synthesis could be given by two of his phrases: "Yo soy yo y mi circunstancia" (I am myself and my circumstance) and " I only offer a way of considering things" (modus res considerandi). A great philosopher and a great writer. His was my main intellectual influence.
__label__2 A Great Performance.: To begin with, this is NOT the Mahler 6th contained in Tennstedt's complete LPO cycle. The performance here was recorded live in 1991 in Royal Festival Hall by Keith Wilson and remastered for Toshiba-EMI by Yoshio Okazaki. Although 91 minutes long the performance has a sweep and urgency not often heard in even in Mahler. An absolute must.
__label__2 Great journal!: For those of you who like to see "numbers on paper" instead of on a computer screen, this is the book for you. Easy to capture your miles and other workouts on a weekly basis with this journal. This journal also goes hand-in-hand with the Runner's World Big Book of Marathon and Half-Marathon Training. Buy them both - you wont be disappointed.
__label__2 Sima SVS-4: This AV switch works great. Have had it for ~4yrs and not a lick of trouble with it. It automatically switches to the active or most recent active input. Has both RCA and S-Video connectors for video inputs and outputs and will convert between the two types of connections - something the less expensive switches won't do. I really like the SV-4 and need another one but not sure if it's still manufactured or what the replacement is at this date.
__label__2 Something old, something new...: This is the dictionary I grew up with. For more years than I can remember, POD stands for an authoritative yet handy source of guidance for the English language. I still keep an old edition, which was published long before the Soviet Union collapsed.I bought this latest edition out of curiosity. This new edition obviously bears a modern look. Its definitions are concise, clear, and unequivocal. Unlike the Merrian-Webster series, which sometimes substitute a synonym for a definition, this dictionary defines every single word in such an accessible way that the probability for confusion is largely minimised.However, the apparent dismissal of IPA and the adoption of a brand-new system of pronunciation symbols have caused some confusion. Having been used to the IPA and the system of M-Webster, I don't think I need to bother to learn a third respelling system.
__label__1 Run from this Book!: I have a vague feeling that there is an interesting idea in there, but I threw this down after a few chapters.
__label__1 Horrible: The characters were unlikeable and poorly fleshed out. Way too much emotion guiding every move and conversation. The lead character has a bizarre sense of entitlement. The characterization of the U.S. military was laughable.Will never read anything from this author again.
__label__2 This book changed my life...: It opened me the door to the world of understanding the interpersonal communication, understanding my own feelings, desires, needs,...I read a lot of John Powell's other Books (this was my first) and they all impressed me and helped me a lot by personal growth. I found in them a lot of answers or confirmations of my feelings or thoughts, I felt I am not alone,... They helped me to see a direction when having problems in my relationships,... So i consider it for a great honor, to be able to write a review first...summary in few words: "Thank you, John Powell!"
__label__2 This one'll get ya going.: For early music people, this is another great compilation of stuff you just like to put on in the background while doing your daily routine. Good times.
__label__2 This book delivers on EXACTLY what it is supposed to!: Look, this book is a picture book... but so are all James Grayson Trulove books. If you are not familiar with his books then you are missing out. His books are not case studies with pages of boring text. He does not teach in his books, but rather inspire. You know when you have a favorite actor and no matter what they are in you go see it... that is the type of author that Trulove is. He is constantly producing new books with great houses that can give you great new ideas. If you're expecting alot more than great pictures of great houses then get something else. But if you want to peak behind the doors of some really cool new houses then you will love this book.
__label__1 HIM LETDOWN: this is a letdown for him.just go to www.heartagram.com and listen to the sample.it's very weak for such a strong band!
__label__1 Not for the faint of heart...: I agree with the review from the New York reader... Routledge says that the Thinking in Action series, "[...] is clearly and accessibly written. [...] Punchy, short, and stimulating..." On Belief fails on all accounts - it is pedantic, requires a near-encyclopedic knowledge of philosophy, and does not present (according to my own reading) any clearly defined argument. The author rambles, as the other reviewer correctly points out. In one paragraph the author will be talking about one thing, and in the next he will start talking about something else - with absolutely no transition.I'm usually a fan of Routledge books, but this one was very disappointing. Buyer beware!
__label__1 Lies from start to finish: This vile piece of slander is demolished in a publication called 'Manufacturing history: sex, lies and Random House's memoirs of Mao's physician', edited by Q. M. DeBorja and Xu L. Dong, published by the China Study Group.As Lin Ke, one of Mao's secretaries, wrote, "The entire work is a piece of anticommunist and anti-Mao propaganda. Any research work done on Mao Zedong or the history of the People's Republic of China, if based on the fabricated accounts and wild allegations of Dr. Li, is bound to be biased and unscientific, embarking on a path that moves away from historical facts. Moreover, it may lead to errors of great historical import."If you want a truthful account, try Quan Yanchi's book, Life at Mao's side.
__label__2 Fan of Richter or not: an excellent set: Whether you are a fan of Karl Richter's interpretation of Bach's music or not, these Cantatas are worth listening to.There are so many great solists that we can consider these recordings as historical.
__label__1 This is a waste of money: I bought this product after a lot of research but found no previous reviews except for a similar product used to connect to the washing machine. Since I can't find them from the local Home Depot and Lowes I had to order it from Amazon.The installation is quite simple but it does not do anything for water hammer condition.
__label__2 The final days of the Nixon adminstration: Although I am still reading this I am enjoying it immensely. It is very well written and brings me back to a very terrible and embarrassing part of our past. I had read All the President's Men when first released and wish that I still had a copy handy to read it again.I have to keep reminding myself that this is NOT a novel. It is full of intrigue and disception. One wonders how our country survived the reign of Richard Milhouse Nixon
__label__1 Disappointed: A friend gave me a similar item she had purchased at a fair. It was wonderful!The beads inside were plentiful, stayed plump and cool several hours. After soaking item, able to wear it right away without clothing getting wet. Material was soft cotton, that layed quite nicely when tied. Thinking these were the same, I ordered 2 sets. Not nearly the quality that my friend had puchased. Not enough beads inside, cloth was stiff. Unable to wear after wetting material, it soaked my clothing.
__label__1 A Poor way to learn Polish: Dispite the authors assurances, I found it ineffective to try to learn words presented at random, or without logical groupings. Additionally, once you have commenced listening,it is easy to become confused about the word order of Polish to English or visa versa. Would definatly not reccomend this product.
__label__1 KEEP YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!!!: The friction locking pin BROKE the first time I used it..now the cutting blade will not lock in place...A useless piece of junk.
__label__1 Chewy nuts: nuts and mix was not normal texture. Everything was soft and chewySunflower seeds and almonds and all nuts should not be this way.
__label__2 Steve Earle in 2000: Tracks included on Steve Earle's live from Austin, TX in 2000 are as follows: 1. Transcendental Blues, 2. Everyone's In Love With You, 3. Another Town, 4. Taneytown, 5. Hard-Core Troubadour, 6. Someday, 7. Telephone Road, 8. The Devil's Right Hand, 9. More Than I Can Do, 10. I Can Wait, 11. Goodbye, 12. Steve's Last Ramble, 13. Copperhead Road, 14. The Unrepentant, and 15. Christmas In Washington. This 2000 concert presents a striking contrast from Steve Earl's performance in 1986 at the same venue during his "clean cut" days. Steve has grown tremendously over the years as both a singer and a song writer. Damn... Steve on mandolin on Copperhead Road is priceless. Love Copperhead Road! This is a must have DVD for Steve Earle fans, and if you happen to have his 1986 performance you will come close to having complete concert footage spanning most of his career. The sound quality and video are satisfactory.
__label__2 excellent use of body image metaphor and description: While I agree with the above review which finds fault with some of the "mawkishness" of the novel, I find its metaphorical rhythm redeems it. Levin uses physical description and body image literalness and metaphor better than most any other writers. In fact, it is unusual to read a novel that cares so much about the body in all its aspects. And, she does not focus on the cultural icons of the woman's body, but broadens and deepens our relationship to the characters' physicality, and our own. Worth reading for that aspect alone. Also a good plot.
__label__1 Just plain bad: I read this book with high hopes and while there are a fewnicely crafted sentances it is abismal in general.Shooting Elvis is like a bad made for TV movie in thein the vein of Natural Born Killers but utterly guttedof insight. It is rife with overburdened attemptsat cleverness.<<<These opinions are personal and not held by my employeer>>>
__label__1 It looks Cheap in person: This necklace watch's gold looks very cheap in person. It looks better in the picture. I would not buy it again. I was actually a little embarrassed when I saw it because it was delivered as a gift. But I guess you get what you paid for.
__label__2 A good Harry Bosch story, hopefully the last.: I've now read an thoroughly enjoyed all of Michael Connelly's novels. The Harry Bosch series is especially good, with believable police department intrigue.However, the Bosch stories are getting a bit formulaic and predictable, so I hope this one marks the end of the series, at least for a long while.Bloodwork, Connelly's most recent effort was excellent and I look forward to other characters he will bring to life in the future.
__label__2 Painfully beautiful: A book about love, loss, dissapointment - a girl's frustration in life - and the experience of Death, too early in her adolescent's life. Written with sensitivity, in a "painfully beautiful" prose that is almost poetry.
__label__1 Price vs Enjoyment.: The price went up and therefore I will not spend the money to enjoy this product. The value simply isn't worth while.
__label__1 incoherent vitriol: Mr. Goldberg knows how to make a buck; he doesn't know how to write a book. Rants and raves will delight Cons... those who wish to learn would do better elsewhere.
__label__2 Fits anywhere.: I purchase these two at a time. This vacuum fits anywhere at any angle. The suction on it is unreal. My home is mostly wood floors with a few area rugs. Works great for both. The only problem is that the plastic shaft that the back plastic wheel fits on cracks after about 6 months causing the wheel to be loose which in turn makes the vacuum drag the floor. Then I break out another vacuum.
__label__1 Be careful there is a newer model v3 with better cpu!: Be careful! Netgear is not telling people that there are 3 versions of the FVS318 (v1, v2 and v3)! Version 3 has a better CPU and uses a different firmware (v3.0). I feel cheated! Because Netgear sells all the older FVS318 as though they are all the same! Not the newest v3 model! What a low life company somebody should sue them. If the Netgear FVS318 has a new cpu then give it a new model number! But they don't, so most of us are buying earlier out-of-date models! Those of us who thought we were buying the latest model were being scammed and defrauded! Shame on Netgear!
__label__1 I'm sorry you asked.: I bought 2 of these heaters because I've had one exactly like it for several years that works perfectly. These were ordered as gifts for friends. One works as well as my own, however (unfortunatly) the other one acted up from the start causing me much embarssment. I have sent it back for credit, and had I not been solicited for feedback I would have not said a thing bad as I believe this is a very good product and that I got the exception not the rule.
__label__2 It's a treasure item for naval aviation enthusiasts.: Jane's has the most informative and intresting titles in military technology. I've always wanted to know how fighter pilots fly and fight. This F/A-18 book is a step by step story on the mission of a fighter pilot. Learn about the airplane, its weapons and capabilities, the mission, and getting back on the boat. I highly recommend this book.
__label__1 What??: A very convoluted story that really never gives any suspense because the answer is the only obvious conclusion. Truly a "huh?".
__label__2 Not 100%, but good: I was a little disappointed because Rosie Cup of Tea wasn't one of the songs, but my grandson loved it.
__label__1 help- jerry maquire soundtrack: I am looking for the name of the song that was not listed on the soundtrack, it is played during the scence when cuba gooding is talking to jerry maguire on the phone right before his famous line of "show me the money"?
__label__2 Pleased with the plot: I just got through reading this, and I must say that I was happy with the job Jeter's take on the Blade Runner world.First off, I am a huge Blade Runner/Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep fan. I know there are many of us, and some take their passion to a higher degree than others. That being said, if you read this book with an open mind, and don't hang on the original book's/movie's every word, you will enjoy this read.Jeter follows the storyline of the movie rather than Dick's novel, but I was able to pick up the story right away. The story is innovative, and fresh. Of course a sequel would be silly now, but I wouldn't mind seeing this book turned into a graphic novel or animation movie.Overall Blade Runner 2 is a fun romp through the Blade Runner world with creative twists and turns. As I said, unless you walk around dressed like Roy Batty or Deckard all day, you should enjoy most of this novel.
__label__1 does not fully work -- no pressure sensitivity: I can use this as a basic pointing device, which does not work as well as my laser mouse, but the pressure sensitive features of this device do not work in any major graphics software that I have tried it in. All tech suport says is "install the new drivers."
__label__2 GOOD PRODUCT: PRODUCT WENT TOGETHER EASILY AND SEEMS VERY STABLE. A FEW OF THE REVIEWS I READ INDICATED IT WAS NOT REALL STURDY BUT I HAVE NOT HAD THAT PROBLEM, THE FOOTINGS ON THIS ONE DID NOT FIT AS TIGHTLY AS I WOULD HAVE LIKE BUT DOES NOT SEEM TO EFFECT THE STURDINESS OR BALANCE OF THE STAND. I THOUGHT THE PRICE WAS GOOD SINCE MOST OTHER LIGHTS I LOOKED AT WERE MORE EXPENSIVE AND OFTEN DID NOT INCLUDE A STAND. FREE SHIPPING WITH AMAZON PRIME OF COURSE WITH 2ND DAY AIR MAKES IT EVEN BETTER. I LIKED IT SO MUCH I JUST BOUGHT ANOTHER ONE.
__label__2 One of the best blues CD's: This CD is amazing! It's one of those ones you can throw on and forget about. Taj Mahal's lyrics and voice make you want more!
__label__1 piece of crap: My girlfriend has had this trimmer for 2 years, and it started giving her trouble right out of the box. She said she thought it was just her inexperience, but that wasn't it.As many other said..it's difficult to start, and runs terribly. The string is a huge pain to keep feeding and re-spool, and it won't stay running unless you run it full throttle, which is incredibly noisy. It also started smoking this season. And at this time, the shaft won't spin. That's happened several times as well.She's gonna look for a new trimmer asap. We might just set this thing on fire soon.I'd give it 0 stars if I could. This trimmer doesn't have a single redeeming quality.
__label__1 Tedious!: Maxwell's writing is enjoyable but the restraint of his characters makes the story very slow-moving and boring. Reading this book was a chore
__label__1 Turgid and tough going: I bought this book out of curiosity about the "movers and shakers" of the real estate industry. I know there have been obscene amounts of money made there, and I was interested in getting an insider's look, as I know Tom Wolfe spent a significant amount of time with some real estate industry magnates. However, as a novel, the book doesn't really work - it's hard to sustain any interest in or sympathy for the main characters as they fall further and further into untenable situations caused by their own greed and lack of self-awareness. Frankly, I couldn't even finish it.
__label__2 Good Read: This is an excellent book. Well researched. A little heavy sledding in some places. Author does a fair job of showing where he is speculating and where he is reporting.
__label__1 Contrafan: Come on...we BUY the CD and can't put it on our ipod!!Sure install software to create security breaches in your system.AND only 2 good songs...what a rip.1 star for the music.-1 star for greed. THIS IS A HUGE ZERO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
__label__1 Blows fuses, problems internally: I have had my unit for 3 years and it worked great until now. It has been blowing fuses recently and now it just blew something inside. I opened it up and can see the damage. I would look at other options.
__label__2 jack jones, an excellent singer: Jack Jones has a wonderful voice, a soft baritone, and also good tastein selecting the standards of easy listening music. For those who lovethis kind of music, this is one very good CD.
__label__1 A 12 Year wait and this is the best she could do?: Repetitive, slow, and too detailed.How could there have been a 12 year wait for a book that was for at least the first 700 pages a repetition of the first books? How many times do we need to be told Alya has to go to the bathroom more often now that she is pregnant? Do we have to have her show how to make fire over and over and over? Where is the plot, the suspense, the action?I do not recommend buying this book, get on the waiting list at the library.
__label__1 Perfect Example of Overblown 70's AM Rock: I personally have never understood the appeal of bands such as Steely Dan, Boston, Chicago, etc. A musican friend of mine told me to give Steely Dan a try. In his opinion Donald Fagen is one of the most gifted musicians around. Well upon one listen of this CD I knew my worst fears would be confirmed. There is nothing "new" about this compilation. It is as derivative as anything else done by this less than mediocore band. If you really want to hear a quality CD try Van Morrison's Astral Weeks or the quintessential Blood on the Tracks by Bob Dylan. Your money will be better spent.
__label__2 Great value: The router is as advertized. I have had no problems with the router since it was installed. My IT expert recommended this router and I would certainly recommend it as well.
__label__2 This is the way to make canned applesauce.: I canned eight gallons of applesauce without having to take this product apart and clean it. That is a big deal for me, what a time saver. Everything else I have used usually clogs up, and I have to stop to clean it out.It left all the good stuff in, and the core and seeds were discarded as dry as can be. NO WASTE!
__label__2 Most recent Calphalon Purchase: This set is great as is all the other Calphalon products I've ordered from Amazon.
__label__1 For god's sake Laurell, go back to Anita!!!!!: Let me start off by saying that I am a big fan of Laurell K Hamilton--I have all of her Anita Blake books, and I even LOVED Kiss of Shadows. However, this book is seriously ridiculous. Hamilton has ruined the great start she had with Kiss of Shadows. I mean, Merry and Kitto? That is beyond perverse, not to mention how she disgraces Doyle in creating such a silly, insulting, and basically racist family history for him. It's so bad that it's embarassing to admit that I ever read it.
__label__2 Education advocates need to read this: People from all sides of the education issue need to read this book. It is well designed and dispels many of the criticisms often presented during arguments (debates). Of course, with any statistical data, one can find faults, but Bracey does a pretty good job of covering all his bases.Even if you disagree with Bracey and others who think the education system is just being attacked, you should read this book. At least then, you will avoid embarrassing yourself by making ludicrous statements.
__label__2 The TRAILBLAZER: this set is Very powerful.Bessie Smith is The Real Deal.Everything about Her Music&VIbe is Ground-Breaking.From Billie Holiday to Rap of TOday have Been Influenced by this Lady.you feel the RealNess in Her Voice&Soul.She has so Much Feeling&Expression in Her Work that it still Sounds Fresh Like it came out Yesterday.Bessie Smith is in a Class all unto Herself.
__label__1 BLACK HOLE FOR INK. total ripoff. should get a 0: Canon Pixma MP830 Office All-In-One Inkjet Printer (0583B002)This is the worst printer I have used in 25 years of computing. They have rigged it to mix color ink to produce black and white document. Anyone considering buying it should check out this url:[...]In spite of scores of hours on with tech. support I cannot get it to do the simplest tasks like linking a scan to an email or faxing. It uses up colored ink like a black hole even though I have not printed a single color document. When a colored ink is used up it will not function at all. it uses about $70 dollars worth of ink to print around 200 black and white pages. once the color ink is used up (which happens even if you are only printing b and w it stops working altogether and you have to replace 5 cartridges. i wish i could give it a 0. i hope that the company gets a class action law suit.
__label__1 Poorly Made: We bought this for Christmas. Here we are 3 days later and it isn't really played with even though this was my daughter's most desired item. All of the snap in pieces fall off when barely touches. The crown won't stay together. The elevator is nearly impossible, even for me, to raise and lower. I read other reviews about supergluing the pieces together so I will be doing that so she can play with it.
__label__1 Creepy, Bad Energy: I've tried this deck on multiple occasions and find it creepy with bad energy. I think Crowley was a genius but he clearly abused whatever knowledge he was given and that negativity pervades these cards in an uncomfortable way. I'm not saying they're not accurate and this isn't a visually rich, masterful body of work on Crowley's part. But there are other decks out there that bring together the same elements without the strong negativity present here. (Try Haindl instead -- earthy & grounded but just as symbolically rich.)
__label__2 Best brand of "chux" I have yet to see: I bought this particular version of chux based on the other amazon reviews and I'm glad I did. These don't disappoint. I like this particular size. I use these to line the bottom of my parrot's cage (odd, I know). But I've used other variations and they just couldn't hold up. The cotton is evenly distributed and has the plastic blue border that holds up well. The speed of delivery was lightening fast and I think the price was very fair. Happy with purchase!
__label__1 Poorly designed: Lousy directions--obvious that the writer of the directions did not try putting the Hydrofarm together. I found it impossible to attach the light to the stand with the parts supplied.
__label__1 WARNING - not compatible with Intel Macs: This product does not work when connected to an Intel Mac running 10.5 (Leopard). Keyspan has been acquired by Tripp Lite and after several frustrating adventures with their tech support, it appears that there is no plan for further development activity. This would seem to be a dead product, at least with respect to the Mac.
__label__1 Way Too Big for Standard Portable Sewing Machine: I feel really dumb for getting this case now that I'm reading others' reviews.I have a compact Brother Sewing Machine (2600i). I decided I should protect it when not in use so I went to the Amazon product page for my machine and trusted that Amazon was recommending a "matching" carrying case. The case they recommend and I bought is so big that there are 1.5 inches of space on both sides and 2.5 inches in front and in back of my machine. Therefore the case protects my machine from dust when it's in one place, but if I lift and carry it the machine can rock inside the case. So it's not ideal as a carrying case. Plus it takes up so much room. Very disappointing.Unfortunately returning it costs nearly $10- hardly worth it for a $20 item.
__label__1 Don't Belive the Hype: The most overrated album of the year. It is in no way deserving of all the high marks. I remember listening to it at the record store and thinking that it didn't really grab me. But I thought, "Everybody says it's really good, maybe it'll grow on me." I should have trusted my instinct. Except for "Shiver" and "Yellow", it's just dull, mediocre at best. I can't believe people compare them to Radiohead.
__label__2 Revisit a legend: I love this album; it was my first experience with Black Sabbath's legacy and it introduced me to the origins of the heaviest kind of rock. This is a sincere homage full of passion and spontaneity; some of the best '90s bands of this style, like Sepultura and Faith No More, help their audience to know about their influences in a very creative way, putting new life into classics like 'Symptom of the universe' or 'War pigs'. Don't miss your chance to enjoy an entertaining ride and compare it with the original one to appreciate the work of Biohazard in 'After forever' or White Zombie in 'Children of the grave', for example.
__label__1 Very little of value...: Like some of the other reviewers, this was pretty much the first book I ever read on the subject, but later as I studied more, I discovered that Wilson has so filled this book with bias and irrelevancy as to make it virtually useless.It's only saving grace is that so many players in the game are namechecked that the interested student will at least know where to look. There is also the final chapter, "Glimpses", which might have made a good small book on its own, with its discussion of "Faculty X", that I rather liked.On the whole though, I can't say that the brand new edition is worth it--you'd be better off purchasing this one from an Amazon Seller.
__label__2 Nice straight-ahead jazz guitar: A very pleasant album of jazz standards by one of the most-overlooked guitar players of our generation. Always experimenting, forging new paths, this album finds Larry returning to his swinging jazz roots, playing with a stellar group--Kenny Barron on piano, Buster Williams on bass, and Marvin "Smitty" Smith on drums. If you like straight-ahead jazz guitar played with exquisite feel, you'll love this album. Highly recommended.
__label__2 OK: Great product. Strong. Must use labels, however, as the surface is slick. Must mark own handling warnings also, as product is also blank.
__label__1 not happy: Taps are mostly bottom taps ok for repairing but not starting new threads. Also box is not the same as what is shown.
__label__2 A nice compliment to their music.: The music is the same but the imagery brings new context to some of the classic songs. There are some interesting interview segments but they are brief and scattered between the venues. This is not one of those documentaries that is essentially a prolonged band interview. This is a visualization of their sound. The main video (Heima) is great but there is also a second DVD with additional live performances which is equally wonderful.
__label__1 trammpoline: I DID QUITE A BIT OF RESEARCH AND THE PRODUCT MET ALL MY EXPECTATIONS. THIS IS MY SECOND TRAMPOLINE AND I AM AWARE OF THE BENEFITS IF USED REGULARLY.
__label__1 Great watch, fatal weakness: I like everything about this watch ( thin, lightweight, easy to read ) but the knob catches on many items of clothing. This often pulls the knob out, which stops the watch, unbeknownst to its wearer. The result is you can't trust it to tell the time, which is a bad thing for a wristwatch. I have had it about 6 months, probably found that it had stopped 20 times or so. A few times I was aware of it, usually not. It has always been just the knob getting pulled out, presumably by clothing ( because I've seen it happen ).
__label__1 too fragile for fun: I bought this headset, and not even within a year, it broke. It's way to fragile, and needs to be more sturdy. Granted, it's just being worn on your head, but when it gets set down, shared, what-have-you, accidents happen (and its happened more than once).
__label__2 Can not put it down: I can not tell you how inspiring this story is on so many levels. I have tried to pick my favorite person I believe it can not be done.
__label__1 Honor, courage, duty, hokum: Now that the cold war is over, America should take a cold shower and re-examine this fascinating (if overblown) episode in its history and once more dare to interpret it (perhaps even objectively) for the silver screen. John Wayne's embarassing rendering ages badly - unless, of course, you are a John Wayne fan. Wayne is less interested in history than in a make-believe story of what he thinks history is. As a proud liberal and American I will state it loud and clear: This movie is junk.
__label__2 Inspired recipes...great book: Mr. Weinstein has captured the very essence of ice cream. This book has everything. Ice cream cones? In there. Every kind of ice cream flavor you can imagine? Yep! And if you're unsure about some of the more obscure recipes (which you shouldn't be), there's 3 different recipes for vanilla! You simply can't go wrong.
__label__2 Finally!!: Wow this show is still just as good as I remember! I'm so happy I bought this...I used to watch this every day when I was little and now I can watch it again.. over and over. lol! It's so entertaining, the dialogue, the characters, very sharp wit and humor. You can't go wrong with Gummi Bears, I guarantee 5 out of 10 people you meet can sing the theme song! Go gummies!
__label__1 Pet Bed: I purchased this pet bed for my dad's outside dog to put inside the doghouse to give her some extra warmth. It is a little thinner than what I expected. There is not much support in the bottom of the bed. I would have expected more padding. I kept it because it was not worth the price to ship back.
__label__2 D&D: loved the book. the leather binding gives it a beautiful touch on one of the Dungeons and dragon most bought book i loved it.
__label__2 a great marketing book for entrepreneuers: I thought this book was a great help for all entrepreneurs. It is as good as Power Promoting: How To Market Your Business to the Top! which I just finished reading. I strongly recommend both books.
__label__2 Dont BUY GAME BOY SP: IF you Are getting Game boy SP AT THis time you are Stupid The Nintendo DS is comming out. Its Small like a Gameboy only it has TWO SCREENS!!!! And The DS is Small But has Graphics Good As the gamecube!!! It is very Costly If you buy the Sp you dont have enough $$$ to buy this DS SO dont buy the SP.
__label__2 Sure to make you smile: This book is just so cute. The story is simple about everyone falling asleep one by one and then getting woke up one by one by "A wakeful flea on a slumbering mouse on a snoozing cat on a dozing dog on a dreaming child on a snoring granny on a cozy bed" The pictures are both cheerful and funny. You will have a smile on your face for sure when you are done reading this and so will the child you are reading it too.
__label__1 Awful: This was just plain awful. I read this book thinking it was written for grades 4 - 6. I guess I was mistaken and it was written by someone in one of those grades. I was hoping for something original, but instead, it was very much a Harry Potter wannabe. This book is what Harry Potter would have been if JK Rowling did not have talent. The characters were flat and uninteresting. I just couldn't bring myself to care about what happpened to any of the characters.
__label__1 What Next? Jack Ryan, Chief Justice: Please. I have read most of Clancy's books and enjoyed them. This one, however, was worse than any biological assault an evil nation could think of. I really wanted to give it no stars, but alas I can not. Clancy's political views and somewhat poor understanding of public administration aside, the plot was absurd, dull, and predictable. And the shallow, trite dialog leaves me at a loss for words!
__label__2 An eye-opener: It often occurs that the movie version of a classic novel differs greatly from the book, but in this case the difference was astounding. The original B&W movie bears almost no resemblance at all to the book. The "monster" is actually benevolent and good-natured, and becomes violent only after being mistreated. The novel focuses much more on Dr. Frankenstein's personal struggles with his own actions. Worth reading just to set the record straight. (I read the Kindle German translation.)
__label__1 You've GOT to Be Kidding!!!!!: I've always enjoyed this movie. It's a fun film with a great cast. I own the VHS and have been waiting for the DVD release. However, YOU DON'T REALLY EXPECT ANYONE TO PAY $48.00 FOR THIS VIDEO, DO YOU????
__label__1 I thought this had promise....: I purchased this as a replacement for a Cuisinart Grind & Brew, fully knowing that I was heading back to pre-ground coffee territory, surprisingly this ended up not being an issue. What was disturbing was the build quality, and to some extent the design.Flatly said, the build quality is poor. The carafe leaks every time your pour a cup of coffee, and the auto stopper consistently gets clogged.The design is such that it has a double flapper for the water and coffee compartments. Water is difficult to pour into the correct compartment, and often gets into the coffee. When the water is heated and pumped into the coffee compartment correctly, it splashes coffee grinds onto the sides and then underneath the coffee filters clogging the stopper.All in all, we are looking at the new Cuisinart Grind and Brew, at least the last Cuisinart lasted four years before we had any problems, the Mr. Coffee began problematic out of the box, and within the first four months began leaking.
__label__2 Surprised by the wonderful flavor of Amy's Southwestern Vegetable Soup: I'm fairly discriminating about what I consider a praiseworthy vegetable soup. I happened upon this one in the organic section of the supermarket & was pleasantly surprised with the flavor & spice. Not overpowering but spiced enough to give the soup & its mixed flavors a standing ovation. Not many 'canned' soups can taste homemade while still maintaining its flavors. Bottom line? A random soup pick has made an enthusiastic customer out of me. I'm hoping Amy's other soups can live up to this introduction...I'll find out when grocery shopping on our return trip.
__label__2 Plantronics Voyager 510 Bluetooth Headset: This product is very comfortable, easy to change between right and left ears. Sometimes a little soft to hear on other end, but normally only noticeable if cell phone directly then midconversation switching to use the bluetooth headset. Overall a very good purchase as it makes life so much easier!
__label__2 he's my man: ah, gilad, what can i say. first of all he is easy on the eyes. second of all he has great workouts that go beyond the old school aerobics, i hate those with the routines and grapevines and all, i have two left feet and no patience. gilad has great kickboxing and weight workouts that i love. this one is another great addition to my growing gilad collection!
__label__2 Sweet story!: Our entire family LOVES this movie! We have fun identifying family members with each character! lol We highly recommend it!
__label__2 Transcendental Meditation: It was a great moment when the DVD arrived and I got into it as soon as possible. It was sent by the author himself giving all his coordinates with the DVD. It is rare to have a personal relation granted with the purchase but it is well within the spirit of the matter. For all of those who luck information on how the Indian spirituality actually arrived in the west, this is a very important document. I immediately after watching the DVD bought the book ' Science of being and art of living by Maharishi and was taken into the world of TM. I would say that the DVD is almost a collectors item by now.
__label__1 Good Ones: I bought these for my kids toys, been using these for almost 2 months now.I am happy with the product.
__label__1 waste of time: reading its features and manual was not difficult, however try uploading music to the sansa mp3 and then you would know about problems. it's supposed to be compatible with windows millenium but guess what?; it's not. i think adding a couple dollars more and purchasing something from apple would have been worth the while.thnks.
__label__2 Should actually be pretty good....: New Year's Revolution 2006 has been building up to be A LOT better than last year. Although the Elimination Chamber match will take place again for two years in a row, the rest of the card will be better than last year.Matches:WWE ChampionshipElimination Chamber Match:Kurt Angle vs. Kane vs. Carlito vs. John Cena [champion] vs. Chris Masters vs. Shawn MichalesTriple H vs. The Big ShowWomen's Championship:Trish Stratus [Champion] vs. Mickie JamesIntercontinental Championship:Ric Flair [Champion] vs. EdgeOther possible MatchesShelton Benjamin vs. ?Chavo Guerrero vs. ?More Matches need to be announced........
__label__2 This show is so fun!!: I really enjoyed watching this show and can't wait for the season premiere in 2013!Highly recommend this !Kelly
__label__1 Written at an 8th grade level... at best: What this author did before writing this book is anyone's guess, but it obviously wasn't research. If he spent as much time actually reading the few masonic sources he uses, he might have come up with a drastically different book! At best, this is a laughable read that will entertain anyone who has done any masonic research.
__label__1 Worst album Ive bought so Far this year.: ok this Band could be really good If they changed 1 thing.This one thing they should change is the Singer.Hes got a terribly Annoying voice.Alot of people were telling me that I should buy this album...so I did.The only song I was able to listen to was "Monster".I Didnt even know that was in rotaion on radio until someone told me.But the other songs on the album are really bad.Unless you like the way Mudvaynes singer sounds when he tries to sing,dont buy this cd.And thats Not opinion...thats Truth.ANyone who tells you they sound like TOOL (Which is what I was told by several People)Needs to go out and Buy A Tool cd and compare the 2.They sound nothing Like Tool.They Sound like an Even Worse Version of Trust Company.
__label__2 Very good shape for out-of-print book.: Out of print book that is in very good shape. Very minor wear on cover and jacket only. It was bought as a replacement for book lost couple of years ago in a move. It has 3-4 favorite recipes that we wanted to have again. Pages of book don't even look used.
__label__2 The Greatest Story Ever Told: Hard cover book in excellent shape considering the 1947 printing date. Well worth the money.
__label__1 good while it lasted: Mine stopped working in less than 3 months. As I was drying my hair it all of the sudden stopped. Nothing I could do would make it turn back on. It wasn't that expensive but I do expect it to last longer than 3 months.
__label__2 A must have for VB6 developers being .NETified!: This book is fantastic. If you are a VB6 developer and you want to understand this monster called .NET, then you need to check out this book. This book covers reference types vs. value types, properties, methods, garbage collection, proper OO design, and .NET class design best practices. Many VB developers have never really taken to the concept of Object Oriented development. If you are one that has never needed to learn Object Oriented programming then you NEED to check this book out. This book will show you many of things that you have been missing and how they can make your life easier.
__label__2 scott august: great , wonderfully relaxeing. Beautiful scenery. Even better after fact of seeing a few of sights in person and also nice to see sights i would of loved to visit
__label__1 What a bunch of cr*p: I almost bought this book awhile ago and changed my mind, deciding I should learn more about it first. I went and got it from the local library. Boy, am I glad I did not waste my hard earned money on this junk. It's less about becoming skinny and more about becoming vegan. I'm all about eating healthier but don't really think I can trust the junk these two are trying to feed us. This book might be ok for women who are already leaning towards a vegan lifestyle but for the rest of us, it's just propaganda. Don't waste your money.
__label__2 Great stuff!: This is another of Butch Hancock's typically fantastic records - his third. But the reason I'm writing this is to correct Amazon's track listing, which is actually that of his second album. Tracks are as follows:1) Golden-Hearted Ways2) You Can Take Me For One3) Neon Wind4) Diamond Hill5) Corona Del Mar6) Ghost Of Give-And-Take Avenue7) Some Folks Call It Style8) Her Lover Of The Hour9) Wheels Of Fortune
__label__2 An inspirational saga: Andrews' THE TRAVELER'S GIFT reviews the seven decisions that lead to personal success, emphasizing and analyzing the difference between failure and success. David Ponder was a successful executive once, but feels like a total failure now: once an executive, he works a part-time, minimum-wage job and faces many crises. A life-threatening situation sends him on a journey of discovery in this inspirational saga.
__label__2 Definitely worth the money: Plain and simple, this hides and protects cords that you have going through your room. You never have to worry about tripping over lose cords anymore. Definitely recommend.
__label__2 Hard Rock At Its best!!!!!: This is one of Sabbath's best albums. They seem to have it all at this point...great songwriting, vocals, guitar hooks, bass-&-drums. Fantastic heavy sond. From start to finish this collection of songs takes you on a fantastic listening journey. It doesn't matter if you like OZZY or DIO this is one excellent album!!!
__label__2 My favorite Agatha Christie: Even though I had seen the movie before I read the book, this book was still very entertaining. If you do like this book, you might want to try _Toward Zero_ and _They Came to Baghdad_, which are my second favorite Agatha Christies.
__label__2 Great Investment!: Has helped me a lot in journaling my workouts. It's helped me in tracking my improvement and in memorizing my workouts. It makes working out more organized..By tracking your improvements carefully, you will see how your are improving and will encourage you in achieving your daily/weekly goals, that will later affect your major goal. You will see how your strength and size is improving, and how your cardio, diet, and supplementation is affecting your performance and body-fat percentage.
__label__2 Great magazine pouch...: You'll have to go a long way to find a better magazine pouch for your .45 cal 1911 magazines. I don't have any regrets at all and I highly recommend it...
__label__1 DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!: it runs out of ink way too fast, its a waste of money.....too expensive for how long it DOESN'T last!
__label__1 After 4-5 wearings, the belt started to separate (the black side from the brown side): After 4-5 wearings, the belt started to separate (the black side from the brown side. SAVE YOUR MONEY - DON'T BUY IT!
__label__2 Just the way I remembered: I remember reading this book as a boy, so when I ran across it again I bought a copy for my five year old. Its a story that captures the young imagination.
__label__1 different readings: My wife and I both use this scale. Each of us can stand on it three times each and we can get three different readings. We are going back to our scale which is about 13 years old.
__label__1 Just plain awful!: I guess I should have known I would get what I paid for. This CD is filled with mostly unknown, low-quality Christmas music. The rest is just plain cheesy.
__label__2 Maybe The Best Made For TV Series Ever Made: If you haven't seen this series get a copy of this DVD any way you can - beg, borrow or steal it. This is a lesser known Dickens tale masterfully adapted for the screen. A timeless rags to riches to rags tale that runs the full gauntlet of human emotions and is filled with characters from every walk of life. The cast, acting, sets, cinematography and editing are all absolutely first class.This is not ever going to be a pop culture favorite but if you enjoy classic drama you will be hard pressed to fine anything any better. The story is fairly complex given it has so many characters whose lives are intertwined but the use of flashbacks helps keep the audience up to speed plus gives the program a rich texture and depth that is not very common today. Kudos to WGBH (Boston) and the BBC.Bottom-line: This series (5 episodes) should not be missed - you will be depriving yourself of four or five hours of true cinemagraphic enjoyment if you do.
__label__2 It's great: I have listened to the Diodes since their first album. If my house was burning, and I could save either this album or my family....I would grab the album. sorry, kids.
__label__2 Love this slide: I recently feel in love with the sudini brand, and this shoe is no exception. They are incredibly comfortable and fit my foot very well.This slide fits just a bit wide at the ball of the foot -- I would say a C/D width -- which is fine for me. Length is perfect.
__label__1 It WAS a great product: I bought this sweeper about a year and half ago. Really like it for quick cleanups. Worked great on hardwood and low pile carpet. The sweeper started to lock up toward the end. It would run over the floor for about a minute and half and just stop. So, I figured I'd just order a new one and save the old one for backup parts. I got the new one and charged it following the guidelines of the booklet. Well, guess what, the new one didn't run any longer than the old one after a year and half. It's really too bad, because I really liked the old one for the time it worked. The company could really have a great product, if they'd work out the bugs with the battery.
__label__2 Great set of speaker stands: I love these speaker stands. They are pretty heavy and fit my Yamaha speakers great. The screw to connect the stand to the speakers is a little long but not too bad. Great buy for the price.
__label__1 Copper coated aluminum: Copper coated aluminum, low strand count. Garbage wire; my speakers sing now that I've replaced this aluminum junk with proper oxygen-free copper wires.
__label__2 JFM: Nice case. Seems to be constructed to last. Thankfully the case holds my 32 Win Special rounds nose up with the tray rotated to the high position. Got that info on another sites Q&A; section.Shipped separate from from other item on order and took quite a bit longer to receive.
__label__2 Easy to use: I've been using this in my daughter's room for a few nights now and am glad I purchased it. It was very easy to set up and figure out how to use it right out of the box.I don't find the glow to be too bright for her room - there is a button to adjust the brightness and on low I think it's just fine.I like the variety of sound options to choose from - one night we'll listen to white noise, the next night rain, the next night the ocean waves. I think all of them sound fairly realistic and I like that you can adjust the volume of the noise to the level you want.I would recommend this purchase -for the price I think it's a very good buy.
__label__2 Gnocchi Board Works Great!: I bought the gnocchi board for my daughter and the gnocchi came out so beautifully and looked very professional. We have always made them by either pressing with our fingers or with a fork, but the board is easier, faster and the final result is so pretty.
__label__1 Needs special Charger: I purchased 2 of these high powered batteries for my 5 year old guns and received them just find out that I need a special charger which I cant find anywhere unless I buy an entirely new gun. It wood be nice if this info was posted on the site and not just on the box when I received it. The batteries were shipped in a timely fashion and in perfect shape. But only good for a one-time use since I cant charge them with my 15-min charger.
__label__2 A must read for every Man.: We need more guys like Warren Farrell. This is a critical book that every man should read. Warren has all the credentials to write about the prejudice against men with authority. I have suffered some of these injustices myself and it was helpful to hear that I was not unique. There are some real eye-opening facts in this book that might get men to start showing some backbone.
__label__2 Made me want to believe!: Its been a long time since Ive had this much fun with this particular subject matter.
__label__2 In you want to do Flash you need to read this book: Fine. If there is a person on earth worse for manuals, that is going to be me.For once I found a book technical and friendly at the same time. As normally happens, there are always some black holes in books where the authors start to assume that you know something you never heard of, or it is not explained in the book you are reading. Well, this is not the case. Everything is explained. When I say "everything" I mean it. Absolutely everything is explained as if you never heard about Flash at all.My most sincere thank you to the authors of this book. I was scared about the power of Flash. Now I have my own Flash designs up and running, most of them helped by this book.
__label__1 Defective CD: This is a karaoke tape; however there are no lyrics. The cover says "full lyrics" but there are none. Therefore, this tape is of no use to me. I e-mailed distributor but received no response. I would like a refund or a working cd.
__label__1 FUELED BY THE PRE-TEEN SUBURBOBRAT: This is a weaker version of one of those NOW CDs. Hasnt he made enough money from BIG, cant he stop even after the man is dead. When will people stop buying this. Who buys this. I think its the 12 year old suburban brat who runs to mommy, crying "give me more money and have the made drive me to the mall, unless i get a shiny jacket, a fubu shirt, and the new Puff Daddy CD, the kids in my private school wont think Im cool"
__label__1 MCS Training Kit: Aside from an occasional good definition, this book is an example of how not to write a technical book. The authors assume so much on the part of the reader that even this IT pro has difficulty following him. I am certified in 7 and I found this book quite incomprehensible. I am getting the Wrox series to see how good they are. I generelly find MS-Press books to be rather good but this one seems to be a copy of Books Online. In fact the authors skip over so much material casuaslly refering the reader to see "Books Online." If I wanted to do that, I wouldn't have gotten the book.
__label__1 Lasting power not good: Replaced factory Suzuki horn with low-tone Freeway Blaster. Not much louder than OEM, but had more satisfying tone. Horn lasted about a month and then started sounding like it had strep throat and began croaking. It's a nice, inexpensive initial purchase, but replacing it every month may reduce cost savings substantially. For that reason, I give it no more than a 2. It gets a 2 because I'm sure there are other Freeway Blasters out there that last much, much longer. I'll try a different brand next season.
__label__1 golly miss hathaway i am a big star!: well jethro did a little better on the beverly hillbillies and least he made us laugh. max plays a narrow minded sherrif in this movie, but it does show some of the small town mentalities of the 50s and 60s. still worth watching.
__label__2 SO EXCITED TO WATCH THIS AGAIN!: I had to give this 4 stars instead of 5 because of the price. I think it's a little pricey compared to other TV shows, but it's totally worth it in the end. Walker Texas Ranger always teaches good values. I wish there were more shows like this on TV.A word about Amazon... I purchased this set directly from Amazon and it was $5 less the following day and then $13 less the following week. They would not credit my account even though I hadn't received it yet. LAME. I guess I could send it back and then buy it again, but that is more hassle than it's worth.
__label__2 Great series!: I am a big fan of this whole series. I love English history and enjoy the dramatization. Can't wait to view the Borges also.
__label__1 Not worth the effort: I am not in the habit of complaining or whining, nor am I an habitual reviewer of other people's literary efforts, but really! This book would incite the most docile personality to action! I have never before read such a badly written book - and I have read many, believe me.Apart from the ending, which was rushed and left much unresolved, my main concerns arise out of the story's lack of veracity. Grossman's characters were just not believable. There were massive discrepencies between speech pattern and characterization....... I could go on, but why waste more time on this book reviewing it - I already wasted enough reading it!I wonder if anyone at the publishing house actually read this book before it went to press? If so, I can only guess that it must have been a half-brained teenager on work placement.
__label__2 Money well spent.: I have really struggled to obtain collectors information on the FS commando knife for a while now, this book seemed to be the answer. How wrong I was, this reference book IS the answer. Identification of various knives is a breeze, and I have been able to ID 2 (same) of mine that had I had no idea what thier origin was. I have one though that I cannot match though. In my opinion this was money well spent.
__label__2 EDUCATIONAL: There is a lot of explanatory speech in CD. I was hoping to listen to bird sounds and relax when I ordered this. But all series of Birding by ear from PETERSON field guides are with speech. Actually it has the name guides, so I don't blame the product.If you need to analyze and study bird sounds all series of "Peterson" are ideal for you.If you want to relax listenning to the bird sounds, mixed with nature sounds like rivers, waves and rain, then you should check products from DON GIBSON (like bird morning songs or SACD-Surround Audio CD symphony).
__label__2 Very Good but somewhat uneven: This difference between this album and all the others is that it actually contains some really bad songs. If you were to take the best songs from every Eagles album and compare them, only Hotel California would be stronger than The Long Run. But of course, there are 10 songs on the album. I Can't Tell You Why and Heartache Tonight are the best songs on the album. Schmitt did a helluva a job replacing Randy Meisner. His bass, vocals and vocal harmony are every bit as good as Meisner's. The Sad Cafe, In The City and the title track are all also excellent songs. The King of Hollywood is a dark and good song, but it is no Hotel California, for sure. The rest is crap. The Disco Strangler is the worst Eagles song by a mile and the only Teenage Jail even rates "filler" status. Still, this is a very enjoyable album, even if it is probably the worst single their debut album.
__label__2 I Am NOT a Gamer Review: I don't care what anyone says, the Wii is fabulous. This one was bought for my 75 year old mother. The whole extended family, from 2 year olds to 80 year olds enjoy playing Wii games. None of us are true gamers and I think many of the elitist reviews are some sort of video game snobbery. Pretty much everyone, but the 2 year old, is able to instantly play and enjoy all the Wii games. The fitness benefits are also tremendous. There are so many games available that give you a work out while you are having fun. I recommend the Wii to everyone. It is well worth the money.
__label__1 Bad Movie: The story is about a girl named Helena whose father runs a circus but she is unhappy and wants to run away. She gets in to fight with her mother who is rush to the hospital after wards (for reason that are never explained, and believe me there going to be a lot of unexplained stuff in this film) Helena goes into shock and one night why she is asleep she drifts off in to a weird fantasy world that seems to be made from her weird art. Here she meets a mask man named Valentine and to gather they go on a quest to find the Mirror Mask. The world it self is really cool looking but the story dose not make any scenes. Its mainly just weird images after weird images witch after while gets vary boring. I also got the Impression that this movie was made for girls but the movie really has no point to it at all. You will forget all these Characters the next day (Besides what they look like) and feel great when it's finally over.Avoid at all cost!
__label__2 Good Item.. Recommended..: This item is nice & as described.. Fits into Nikon 52mm lens correctly.. Good Performance.. Recommended..I wanted to send this as a gift item.. So it would have been better if the gift wrap was available for this..
__label__2 Transitions: I am an avid fan of DM, and will do the best job at being objective about their work. Although, I think this album is great and it has many quintessential DM songs, there are some songs that I often skip over. These songs are definitely not my favorites, but I think mostly that they just don't appeal to me in the context of this album. This is why I label this "transitions". I love all periods of DM, but I notice this one seems to be one that incorporates the earlier "new wave" feeling of previous albums but also ushers in the darker era of DM. I tend to prefer the darker DM, but appreciate the earlier work especially if not simultaneously. If you are even a slight fan of their work, you will enjoy this album.
__label__1 Propaganda for a dictator: Kimura's book smiles and applauds Fujimori from beginning to end. Like a cheerleader, Kimura jumps with joy as Fujimori violates Peru's constitution--she calls his despotic attack on Congress "a daring bid to wrench control." Fujimori came under international condemnation, but Kimura dismisses any concern, calling it a mere "ruckus about human rights and democracy." Kimura is so intent on making Fujimori a hero, that she doesn't seem to mind all of the citizens he tortured. Nor does she have anything but praise for Fujimori's brutal neo-liberal reforms, which caused terrible suffering for millions of poor Peruvians: she prefers to call it "the Peruvian Miracle." Kimora thinks that the ends justify the means, but what are the ends? Peru is beset with poverty, military terror, and daily violence. And now we learn that Fujimori was corrupt to the core, stealing millions of dollars from the nation, while children go hungry. A disgusting man, a deplorable book.
__label__1 Compatability issues: I too have had problems with installing this game on my daughter's computer that runs Windows XP with the IE7 update. Tried it on my CPU with Vista and it didn't work either. I'm surprised that this was the only game that didn't work since all her other games (Lost City, Animal Adventures, BackPack game, and Diego game) work without any problems. I wonder what's so special about this game?
__label__1 snow white and the huntsman: movie dragged on.scenery was beautiful but that only goes so far. Kids enjoyed it so that's what is important.I did'nt really care for it.
__label__1 NOT THE SAME ONE: DIFFERENT FROM THE ONE I SAW 12 YEARS AGO, DID'T LIKE THIS ONE MUCH.TOO MUCH COMENTARY, NOT ENOUGH PERFORMING, MAY TRY AN ORDER AGAIN
__label__2 I thought I would give the Basis Sensitive ...: I thought I would give the Basis Sensitive Skin Bar soap a try. I have very sensitive skin and find that there are very few products gentle enough for my skin. I really liked the soap and I found it to be very gentle. It didn't make my skin burn when I used it -- it practically soothed it. The only problem was that it still turned the skin on my face red for at least 45 minutes after I used it. So if you have VERY sensitive skin and you're looking for a gentle soap to use before bed this would be a good choice.
__label__2 The Princess Diaries: This was a great book. I loved it. It is a book for girls that think they could never be anything. I really loved this book and I think that the next one The Princess Diaries, Volume II will be just as great.
__label__1 Tries too hard: Fun with Dick & Jane is a so-so remake of the 70's original with George Segal and Jane Fonda. Updated in the era of Enron and high-tech electronics, it loses a lot of the innocent, free-spirited fun of the original. Carey, as usual, has some scenes that have no other purpose than to showcase his rubber-faced expressions and Leoni seems rather tired of the whole thing. I actually fell asleep two-thirds of the way through; for a comedy, that's not a good thing.
__label__2 Sleek design: It was first time we had ordered a furniture from Amazon. This bed is very well made and looks very elegant. Assembling side boards was very easy but mattress frame was very tricky. took lot of trial and error. I would have liked if they had provided some kind of cap to cover holes.
__label__2 Doesn't work well without the light!: This will trap and starv a rat or cockroach that happens to walk by, but when used with the flea trap light it's unstoppable!!
__label__2 top of the line: Oh my God I never in my wildest dreams believed that book could help me make money faster than this. My success swooped even me of my feet and I'm not an easy person to surprise. A great title that will help you reach the status of record company owner or star manager easily
__label__2 Great sign: This is exactly what I was looking for. The sign was fairly cheap and is of great quality, I'd recommend any packer fan buying one.
__label__2 Grand Finales is a Grand book: The book "Grand Finales" is a book for all people who are interested in pastry and cooking. It is very discriptive and has many recipies with fondations so you can make mank differnet dishes.
__label__2 Prada Parfum: Prada has been one of my favorite perfumes for the last couple of years...at department stores this bottle is very expensive but buying it on Amazon I was able to purchase two bottles for the price of one. Highly recommended.
__label__2 Perfect gift!!!: If you have a child or a grandchild that loves to draw as does my granddaughter, they will love this. She has been busy with this ever since Christmas. Well worth it!!
__label__1 Not worth the money: Like other customers, I found that this DVD was a very poor copy of the film which I had been waiting to purchase for a long time.
__label__2 floppy disk: I have a lot of pictures on floppy disk and was thrilled that I can still get them on my computer with this USB External Floppy Drive
__label__1 Wow, how embarrassing....: I'm embarrassed for everyone involved in this idiotic...movie. You can tell Duchovny's embarrassed because his performance is even more catatonic than usual. POintless mindless & tasteless. Should make lots of money.
__label__1 Too much static: I found this phone to have too much static. I changed the channel several hundred times to see if that helped but it always had the same amount of static. Also, you have to get it to sit just right on the base in order for it to charge, you have to move it around a little to make the light come on so you know its charging, which isn't a big deal, but a little annoying. Im very dissappointed with my purchase of this phone. I have been searching for an inexpensive 2.4 ghz cordless phone that looks nice and fits in with my decor along with working well. I thought this phone would be great for it is very nice looking and the phone does feel very sturdy and not light and flimsy like some of those out there, but unfortunately this phone has too much static for me to give it a good review.
__label__2 Good second installment: 2 books in this series in, and I have burnt the midnight oil this week to finish both. Great setting and three dimensional main characters. My concern is that I have come to this series late, with 30+ already written. Hope the quality doesn't drop off.
__label__2 Really cool set: This is a real nice pennant set made of fairly thick material. The price was definately a plus paying only about .35 cents a piece. The only small complaints I have are that the Buffalo Sabres logo is the 'bannana slug' and that the Blackhawks pennant is just the C with the two tomahawks that is located on the shoulder of the jerseys and not the actual head that is on the crest of their jersey. You can't tell from the pic provided but every single pennant has 'Rico/Tag Express' printed on the front of each pennant and with the pennants being so small this writting detracts from the overall appearance of the pennant set.
__label__1 Disapointing: Being a big BSG fan, I pre-ordered this. This was a disapoitingly written script and just seems to milk fans of more money after the series ended. If I had known how bas it was, I would have passed on buying it. It wasn't worth the money or the space to keep it to know about the missing parts of the plan. For those that do not already own or have carefully watched all 4 seasons, it would be very difficult to follow what is going on.
__label__1 Snipes can do better!: This movie is a rip-off of many other action movie...It felt like a little bit of Mission Impossible with a pinch of Enemy of the State thrown in. Wesley Snipes stars as a U.N. spy, a very typical character in these James Bond style movies of one man takes on dozens, and wins. The plot is as difficult to follow as it is thin. The film centers around the concept that the U.N. is trying to build itself up as a major world power by framing people for the assasinations of heads of state. The movie does not spend enough time to develop this plot and thus leaves the viewer distracted from the action. Throughout the movie, you are presented with a small list of people for the "who-done-it" style ending, which I'm sorry to say was very predictable. Overall, this film is worth watching on cable, but I personally would not pay the money to rent or buy it.
__label__2 Timeless classic: A good read still to this day, in a very important time when the mafia was beginning to come to light more clearly to the public eye.
__label__1 Unnecessary prattle: I must agree that while Jim's life with Pamela deserves as much literary respect as his career or life with Patricia Kennealy, this book falls woefully short of that mark. Its slim bulk is in proportion to how over-priced it is, and its lumbering writing style is beyond tedious. Nice color photos, though. I am still waiting for the book that puts both Pamela and Patricia in equal standing with him - now *there's* a story!
__label__2 An album for my collection: The music of this album is one of many that's from Britney, adding with unique design, that I like.
__label__1 truck ventshade: Tape needed to attach to vehicle was not adequate in size to properly attach the front corners.It was lacking about 2 inches where it curves around front mirror area. The most important spot to attach to vehicle and no tape. I was lucky I had some.You spend 40 dollars for 2 piece's of extruded plastic and they skimp on 2 inches of tape. How smart is that?
__label__2 very good DVD: Very very good DVD, contains tips, fills etc... with clear explanations, lots of material for practice and advance your skills, not targeted for the very beginners, more suitable for intermediate and advanced players.
__label__1 No menu!: This DVD has no menu! As an artist and an art teacher, I purchased it with a genuine interest in enjoying by video the techniques of the Old Masters. The first section starts out with the very basics in shapes and shadows. The artist then moves on to figure drawing. If I want to review a section at a time, the only way to do it is to start at the beginning and fast forward until I hopefully arrive near where I want to be. It is also distracting to see the artist's arm come in front of the camera, plus he rambles. His drawings are well presented, but the video is poorly created.
__label__1 How do you use it? No users; manual!!!: The fancy packaging has plenty of space for an users' manual. Spend less on fancy packagimg and more on making the software useful for the consumer! As it is, the over-priced program is completely useless to me!
__label__1 A slight addition to an excellent series.: STRIP JACK is not one of the stronger books in the "Rebus" series. In this one, Rebus becomes interested in the trials and tribulations of an MP who is caught during a raid on a brothel. This leads to a couple of murders that may or may not be related and Rebus getting involved just out of curiosity. Rankin just seems to be going through the motions on this one, the mysteries are not very interesting and relatively straight forward, Rebus's usual emotional response seems distant and he seems to be in a state of befuddlement about life, career, and even the politics involved in the case. STRIP JACK lacks the laser-like focus of Rankin's other episodes and while I don't think Rankin has written a bad Rebus novel, this one is just a filler.
__label__1 The Wrong Stuff: I thought I would read this book after seeing a long reference to it in "Adventures in the Screenwriting Trade" by William Goldman. Goldman describes writing a screenplay of this book which was never used because of factors beyond his control. Goldman, who wrote Marathon Man and The Princess Bride, gives a synopsis of The Right Stuff that made me interested in reading the novel.I had to put the book down after the first chapter. Wolfe's flippant style is grating. After each fatal crash he mockingly repeats his description of the trainees ritualistic behavoir in donning their bridge coats (their formal uniform) to attend the funeral.The writer relates how worried the young pilots wives are, how they live in fear that their men are going to crash and burn. This is an unusual viewpoint to take in writing about heroic figures. It's as if someone sat down to write a book about Caesar or William the Conqueror written from the perspective of their worried wives...
__label__1 The only good thing about this release...: {Flash! Ah-ah...}How many years have we been waiting?{He'll save everyone of us!}How long have we heard about that "awesome UK release" with all the cool extras?{Flash! Ah-ah...}And what do we finally get?{Savior of the Universe!}The Savior of the Universe release with crappy cover art (give me the original poster art any day), a featurette about the artist who made the crappy cover art (doesn't Flash look wicked and more like Ming in it?), and a featurette about the screenwriter who also wrote the 60's camp classic Batman, as well as Never Say Never Again.Worth the money? No.Now that this is out, the people who have been selling the original DVD release for ridiculous amounts of money on eBay will have to settle for much less, and those who want to replace their old ones thinking this one will be a great buy will probably be selling their old ones for pennies. And that's the only thing good about this release!
__label__2 a fantastic read: I am a 57 yr. old grandmother, I bought the book for my 8 year granddaughter for Christmas and pre read it to see if it was suitable for her and I loved it, I could hardly put it down. I now am hooked and want to see what happens to Harry and his friends next. Margaret Angus
__label__1 1 out of 3 worked: Of the three I've bought only one lasted more than a few months. I don't know what happens to them but they just quit working. First they quit until you unplug it and plug it back in so Windows can find it again. After a while that doesn't fix it either.The software is terrible. It quickly leaves you and your computer confused as to what is in control of the device,or rather not in control.Connectivity, when it does work, is erratic. Measures to mitigate what little interference I had was fruitless.
__label__2 Unexpected Gems: I didn't know what to expect from J.G. Graun. He's a bit baroque, and a bit classical, and entirely fun--but not in a light sense. This is great music from a top-notch ensemble.
__label__2 Short and Sweet: This unfortunetly shortened season (due to the writers strike) is the normal content of an Office season cut in half, but that doesn't mean its not comedic gold.But, make sure you grab it at the lowest price this DVD box will drop, because although the quality is what you'd expect from The Office, you may feel cheated by this short season if you spend more than $30.
__label__1 Not a fan: Like the other posters I have to give this two stars simply for the animation. It is a beautiful looking movie. However, the plot is confusing and uninteresting. The political message is not subtle and takes away from the fun parts of the movie. I was also disgusted by the blatent sexual content. Why is that necessary in what is billed as a children's movie? Overall, I just was not impressed.
__label__2 A Good Compilation!: This singles compilation covers Manfred Mann's HMV years; with Paul Jones as their lead-singer. All British A-sides, except the first two, are included - recordings from 1965-66. Most B-sides are here too, some of which have only rarely been included ( "John Hardy" and "What Am I Doing Wrong" ) on compilations. Moreover a good handful of EP-only songs can be found.The early Manfreds were a funny mixture of pure pop, r&b; and jazz. Some of these tracks sound pretty dated today, but their best singles like "If You Gotta Go", "Pretty Flamingo" and "Do Wah Diddy Diddy" still are great listening. Among the B-sides the Folkish "John Hardy" is quite enjoyable.Among the EP-tracks "The One in the Middle" with its great melody and self-irony stand out.A good complilation.
__label__1 Agree - Not Hot Enough: I also liked everything about this coffee maker, except that the coffee is not hot enough. I will not return it because it would cost 1/2 of what I paid to ship. Stuck with it for awhile!
__label__1 Lost ?: I`m sure the guys in Elegy tried very hard on this CD to produce something mentionable, but I`m sorry to report that in my own opinion it fails to do so.
__label__1 Wish I could give it -10 ( minus 10) No truth in advertising!: if you look at this ..it is 3D and appears to be faceted..be not decieved it is FLAT!This dissapointment would have been enough for me to score this low but the minus numbers arise because of the return policy....you have to jump through hoopes- slalum; climb everest; and oh.... in case you were thinking of sending the item back in a far superior package i.e. bubble envelope- because you threw out the rinky dinkey rubbish cardbord box that it came in... the joke is on you! So dumpster diving time!!!!What a shame! Never AGAIN!!!!
__label__2 Fantastic: Dylan writes this like he writes songs - a series of vignettes, a lot of imagery, an occasional glimpse at someone who looks like he might be the real Bob. A great read.
__label__1 I can't believe this is the same band...: Like a few other people here, I bought this album after falling in love with Confessions of a Knife. I still can't believe this is the same band. This album is atrocious. Simply very very bad. It isn't "reminiscent of" the B-52s. It sounds EXACTLY like them. If you like the B's, this is a great album. I don't like them, I found their sound annoying in the Eighties and I still don't like it, and I'm very sorry I bought this. And having a lot of die-hard TKK fans defensively explain all about the history of the album doesn't make it a better album.
__label__2 Steamy and dark: "Unfaithful" combines mystery, erotica, and drama to create this unique theme. It starts as a happy theme, but once the sexy Olivier Martinez walks into Diane Lane's life, everything changes. The sex appeal steams, then the mystery stomps on it flowing to an unexpected conclusion. The producers, the director, and the writers wonderfully make "Unfaithful" more entertaining.Diane Lane deserved her overdue Oscar nomination for her role as an unhappy wife, the best role of her career. Richard Gere wonderfully plays her character's suspicious husband whose personality changes as his anger grows. Olivier Martinez needs to star in more movies like this in the future.Those looking to steam up a night should watch "Unfaithful". It'll leave the audience breathless and shocked.
__label__2 Got what i needed: I Bought this used. I received it quickly and it was in good condition when i received it. The book itself seems like an excellent too for the use of learning Spanish.
__label__2 Good book to use as a starting point.: I am really intrigued whenever I read a brand new mystery or suspense thriller, which is why I thought about writing mystery short stories. Hence, I purchased this reference book in hopes that it will inform me about everything I need to know behind law enforcement. It does give details on the legal system, the police force and criminals. The author discusses crimes and has a lists of weapons. It does provide minor information on police procedure and "cop talk." In addition, there are extensive lists on books to look at for more information. However, this book does have its flaws. It only contains brief paragraphs on some topics, so don't rely entirely on this book for information to write your novel or short story. It is a detailed book, but does not include as much info. as I had originally hoped.
__label__1 "Herregud!, Look, here goes Isak on his mule, let's watch!": This is an odd and depressing book. Far from Frank Norris or Jack London or Sinclair Lewis or authors intent to describe the homesteading life; there is no manifesto here. There is no bright definition between the good and evil, nor an epic struggle against the land and climate, nor a guerrilla war of one class against another. All the folks here get on rather well considering that two of the three women characters are murders and all of the men are but domesticated farm animals. More (or less) the book lacks even the basic description that would link the reader to the land; no colorful seasonal changes, no waves of migrating birds, no surf on the shore, no simple enjoyment of the earth as the day begins. No Steinbeck here. No Barry Lopez, no Ted Morgan. We have here the novel of the ruminants; grubbing, rutting, and wondering what it's all about. Put this book up in your medicine cabinet; try to read 20 pages whenever you can't sleep.
__label__2 Great CD.: Includes all the best songs of the Bay City Rollers. If you are a fan, you will love it. I definitely recommend this item.
__label__2 great: my new bird loves this bath and it was so easy to installl also very simple to clean and put back
__label__2 Perfect: This is every bit as much Star Trek as The original Series, or Next Generation. But it is the first Star Trek Series that uses no models. Everyting is CGI. So rich people will never have the opportunity to put little space ship models from the show in their conference rooms.
__label__2 Just buy it already: I grew up on Warren Miller and skiing movies, I ski now but have always wanted to learn to snowboard, after watching this movie I have one goal this winter and that to learn.This film is unbelievable. The shots are so well placed but at the same time look as though they happen by accident. From beginning to end its amazing. It is broken up perfectly with non-snowboarding scenes, but they don't seem forced into the movie, just placed where they should be. As soon as you start thinking about the next snowboarding scene it there already.The only movies that are even close to the same category are "That's it that's all" and "Picture This"Thank you Travis Rice and Red Bull, keep doing what you're doing.
__label__2 Great Investment: As the owner of one naughty dog and another sensitive stomach dog, this carpet cleaner has saved me money, hands-and-knees-scrubbing, and sanity. I purchased this after my dog got a canister of cocoa powder, chewed it open, and licked it into my living room carpet. I would have been happy if it just lightened the stain, but after a little work, I can't tell where the cocoa massacre happened at all. Cleaning up dog accidents takes, at most, a quarter of the time it used to with much better results. Spills of any kind are a quick fix. We were able to quickly dry our carpets after a severe roof leak. We were able to move furniture back into place in a few hours. Filling and emptying are quick and simple. Furniture attachments did wonders for our couches. Minimal leaks, only when the cleaner is tilted to a sharp angle or the hose attachment is not properly hung. If it leaks, it's easy to fix with a quick run-over with the machine. Love it and I don't want to imagine my home without it!
__label__2 Ditto: The only thing I can add to the previous review is that the Smartmedia was well packaged. There is a statement with the card that says "The Smartmedia has a limited life span, and will eventually become incapable of performing WRITE/ERASE functions after long-term use. When this happens please replace it with a new one." If this is the case will all Smartmedia cards then what is long-term? I've only has mine about 3 weeks so far.
__label__1 how many eyes looket at it?: Ditto to all the one-star reviewers. And the movie itself isn't even worthy enough to be labeled maudlin. But what does the public want? Bread and circuses. It sells books. That is the real American story here. Get rich quick. Now, I'm going to see if Ms. Gilbert will take me as a client for some prosperity coaching.
__label__2 Two attack buttons and a RPG-like mode don't fool me!: This game is not what the gaming world has promoted it to be.As I've peeled myself from more innovative games and finally given Tekken 4 a chance, I realize how much more fun and interesting it is than Virtua Fighter 4. The fun lasts much longer as well.The most frustrating aspect of this game is its difficulty in the "Kumite" mode. Yes, you can get nifty (usually useless) items, but once you reach a certain point (the fights are seemingly endless) it's like hitting a brick wall!Virtua Fighter has always been plagued with a certain annoyance named Akira. He's the big bad boss-man whose moves can only be performed with useful speed by the computer. And by "useful" I mean ridiculous.I was fooled by the customization mode for a while, but got sick of my memory being guzzled and the computer stealing my glory over two, just two attack buttons.
__label__2 AMAZING VOLUME BY THE PLANET'S TOP EXPERTS!: The North American Menopause Society has recently published Menopause Practice: A Clinician's Guide which is an amazing compilation of up-to-date, state-of-the-art information about a complicated subject that this Society and its members have reduced to a highly readable text. The information is thoroughly researched and provides abundant references while maintaining a readable format that savvy consumers will find valuable. The North American Menopause Society has done something that no traditional textbook can offer - that is, to utilize the best and the brightest of its thought-leaders to review, modify, and contribute in so many different areas involving health care of midlife women at menopause and beyond. Whether you are a clinician, a student, or an interested consumer, this study guide of menopausal medicine is a must for your bookshelf.
__label__2 Java 2 Exam Notes: Programmer's Exam: I am a novice JAVA programmer, but I am also a 15-year computer professional; in my opinion this book is a good refresher book AFTER you've read the author's first book "The Complete Java 2 Certification Study Guide". The content was very good as a reminder of what to study for. In addition, the information on the SUN certification process was as up-to-date as possible, at the time of publishing. But the book should not be your first exposure to the JAVA certification process UNLESS you consider yourself a JAVA-guru. I will definitely have this journal-sized book in my car, in order to peruse it one final time before I walk in and take the exam.
__label__1 Where are you using it?: I'm living in downtown chicago, and I thought it would be cool to have navigation when I walk around downtown. First of all the switch on this thing is defective... I have to turn it on then jiggle it back to get it to start. It connects fine with my blackberry pearl. But that's it. It doesn't work around tall buildings, under cloudy skies, or in some cars (especially taxies it seems). So this has been useless for me.
__label__1 TEDIOUS: The First two or three chapters of this book were OK but then the book just started to get boring. The parts about the main character's past lives are not well written. It's like reading a modern teenager's style of writing set in the middle ages. There were some parts that were written well but most were just not believable. I skipped most of the pages just to read the ending. The concept of the story is really good, but the book was just poorly written.
__label__1 Extra ORDINARY: I was so disappointed with this CD. I read somewhere that Mandy Moore had offered refunds to her fans for her first album. I wish she'd offer refunds for this one. It's not that it's necessarily bad, but just really boring and there's nothing special about it. It should be a soundtrack to a cheezy made for TV movie. She has such a great voice. I loved her Coverage album because it really shows off her voice. Every time I listen to this CD it's like the first time because none of the songs are memorable or leave any kind of impression. The music is pleasant, but nothing I would ever think, "Oh--I really want to hear that song" or be singing to myself later. Big disappoinment.
__label__1 Why Some Songs Are MIssing: I have found out that Henry Gross does not own the rights to reproduce the famous "yellow album" and Plug Me Into Something. However, he has managed to get the rights to a limited pressing and you can order a CD containing both albums off of his website. Why A&M Records does not release the CD's I don't know. But they are great albums and I remember them well from the 70's.
__label__2 Perfect: This is the perfect thing I have ever ordered my mom loves this she can make everything with this ! At least that's what it seems like she loves it.
__label__1 Only bought it for the Danny Dyer nudity.: Which was lacking. Although there was a nice Shawn Hatosy/Danny Dyer kiss which was unexpected but too brief and no tongues. I didn't watch it all from the beginning right through til the end. I just fast forwarded it. Wouldn't reccommend. Not worth buying.
__label__1 Not aware size is TINY: The book is a little pocket edition, not a full size book with the original art on the cover as I thought.
__label__2 Cinderella II - Dreams Come True Indeed a classic!: "Cinderella II" is Absolutly a classic. Cinderella, I believe is on of the best Disney movies, and then when I found out that they made a second...I had to run out an buy it.It is divided into three stories happening after Cinderella and Prince Charming return for their honeymoon. Cinderella learns what it is like for a Princess. I was entertained THE WHOLE TIME. The song are also nice, nothing like the original, but they keep you upbeat.This is THE BEST Disney sequel ever, I like it because they keep the focus on Cinderella and not someone's boring 12 year old child.Disney...this is truely a masterpiece I will FOREVER treasure!
__label__1 Okay For Fun: If you just want to play around and don't expect fine finishes or upscale results, this book is fine. So much more is available that I can't see spending the money on this one.
__label__2 A book worth reading for children & adults: Debbie Miller did a great deal of research before writing this book, so though it is written for children, it is a great account for all to read. I would highly recommend it to readers of all ages who are interested in dog teams and their important role in Alaska. This is the best and most acurate telling of the story of the serum run to Nome in 1925 which I have ever seen. It is a children's book in that it explains what happened from the viewpoint of children. Beyond the story, there are facts presented in the back of the book. Jon Van Zyle is a popular artist, but I did not feel that his oil paintings for this book were all that great.
__label__2 Works great for me: I bought it strickly for backup. It works great.It's a great investment. Being USB portable it's one of the few things you can take with you to a new computer. My only regret was that I didn't buy a 500GB.The only thing that sucked was their packaged backup software. I did some research on line & downloaded "backup4all". It saves the backed up files as zip's. There's a bunch of backup softwares out there & I don't have a clue which is the best but I can attest that this one works great with the LaCie & is easy to use.
__label__2 Simply The Best New Diva: This is simply the best. I can't stop listening to the CD. Alicia has sparked my interest in music again. She reminds me of old Tina Maria. After all the pop divas, a real queen has entered the kingdom. Track 14 (Why do I feel so bad) is the very best on the CD.
__label__2 Doris Day: My wife is a Doris Day FAN. We do enjoy her movies - have seen many from the early sixties in the theater at the time.
__label__2 Good christmas music except for one song: this is typical John Denver but has nice Christmas music except for one song Daddy don't get drunk on Christmas You need to skip through that awful song.
__label__2 So far, so good - 2.5 hours later...: It took awhile to assemble - around two and a half hours - but it wasn't as bad as we thought, or as we have read in some of the other reviews. It is a super cute kitchen and great for the money! I would have paid double for this kitchen. It looks so much better than a plastic kitchen!! It doesn't look tacky or cheap, which I am thrilled about.
__label__1 Not accurate size: This is a really cute Tinkerbell costume! The problem is the size. On the package it says that it will fit up to size 16, however it does not. I could barely squeeze into it. While trying to get out of the costume some of the sheer material ripped, so now I'm stuck with a costume that doesn't fit. My friend bought another costume by Disguise and it said it would fit up to a size 14 and it fit me with plenty of room for breathing and some more. I would not advise anyone over a size 6 to buy this one. Also, it is very short. I couldn't find any reviews or more info on the costume before I bought it, so I hope this helps others looking for costumes.
__label__2 Lots to do for the little ones: 1 year old Grandson loved it, too much there for him to get bored easily. For whatever reason he seems to like the seat a lot, open and insert object-close-open again and remove.It seems well made and easy for him to handle, and his parents weren't upset either-that might change after a couple months though.All in all, well worth seeing the little one have fun.
__label__2 Life Changing: This book has changed my walk with Christ forever! John Bevere's work illustrates the importance of obedience and commitment. Since reading the book I have "planted" myself in a local church and will begin my service once I have finished new member's classes. I thank God for this message. This is a must read!
__label__1 Almost the Worst Ever: I can't imagine how this tasteless, ridiculous, boring movie ever got any good ratings. You have a man talking to his boil! And promoting advertising at the end of the movie (because he went crazy?).
__label__2 I really enjoyed this movie!: I had never heard of this movie when I stumbled on it late one night right before I went to bed. Instead of turning off the TV because it was late and I needed to go to work the next day, I found myself glued to the screen. This movie was unlike any I'd ever seen. Filmed in Italy after WWII, I felt like I caught a glimpse of Italian life in the late 40's. This was not a Hollywood made movie. There was little if no music in the background to manipulate emotions from the viewer yet I was extremely moved by the silence in between the dialogue. There is no Hollywood ending. The movie just ends, but it is not the end of this father and son story. I'm not sure who to reccommend this film too, but I loved it. It was different. I really felt like I was in Rome in the late 40's.
__label__1 Self-indulgent pseudo-intellectual twaddle.: I believed all the hype, enthusiastically sat down to watch it and was bored to tears. Tries desperately to be quirky and cute but ends up being irritating and nauseating.
__label__2 A wonderfull addition to my collection of electronica: Not being a fan of madonna, but being a huge fan of trance (Oakenfold, Sasha) and electronica (Saint Ettiene) I was skeptical to buy this album.Although I think in some sense Madonna as a persona does not really sell well, the music is superb and grows on you rather quickly. The attempts to be "sufi" and "profound" are artificial, BUT highly effective, and I think it is the result of her ability to bring out the recognizable and simple beauty of tone from ORBIT, her partner in this CD so that you get elements of electronica that are just pop enough to please everyone. I would strongly recommend this CD to anyone, especially someone who is trying to get their ears accustomed to electronica.
__label__1 Great and comfortable but NOT portable!: Unless you're Hulk Hogan, Arnold Schwarzenager (in his Terminator days), this is not portable. It is however, comfortable and easy set up and closed up.
__label__2 Daughter was enchanted too: My daughter really liked this movie - in fact, we've ended up ordering it several times. Happy that I just snagged one at a garage sale for $5.00!
__label__1 Not Worth The Money: I work roadshows and needed a hard shipping container to hold my pop up booth so it wouldn't get damaged during shipping. The containers that come with the booth are too big and cumbersome so I wanted one that was easier to handle and cheaper to ship. I bought one at The Container Store that measured 32" x 18" x 13" h but since the handles are formed inside the box, it was just about an inch too short. So I found this box and thought it would be perfect since it was a little longer. The interior is maybe an inch longer but still not enough since I need about another half an inch. This can work for me since I can maneuver the booth to make it work. But the material of this box is not worth the money. This unit is about $10.00 more than the box I bought before but worth about half. If you can get by with a little smaller container, I recommend the storage box at The Container Store.[...]
__label__2 Her-larious: Dislikes: Who sent out the memo that in order to write an African-American fiction novel, you have to say p**sy and c**chie a million times? I can't find a book that doesn't somehow throw that in and it's annoying. This novel was predictable and flat out corny towards the end.Likes: I LOVE Eric. I LOVE LeBaron too, when he was away from Phoenix. Barbershop humor was all through this book and there was only one scene where they actually were in a barbershop. I wish Harmon had written Barbershop 2, because it wasn't funny like the first one. I cried laughing during every conversation Eric LeBaron and the doctor had (minus the end). These characters remind me so much of Method Man and Redman to the point I'm convinced Redman is Eric and Method Man is LeBaron before Method Man got married.
__label__2 Excellent: Steve Murray's approach to Reiki and healing is excellent. Steve believes that everyone can benefit from Reiki and his materials show you why.He walks you through the Attunement procedure so you know what you will be doing. The Attunements can be taken over and over, and provide a variety of experiences for the receiver - all positive, in my experience.Steve Murray is a big part of my healing library.
__label__2 Great expereince: There are not so many video tapes of this opera (actually I know this one and another from an Italian opera house, which is just awful!). I love almost everything in this tape. The music, the singers, the production which is beautiful and goes well with the action. I find the Classical Sabbath specilly original and inspired... Helen of Troy is the most beatiful woman on earth and Gabriela B. feels like it there!I wish Dennis O. would be a better actor, he is always looking at the pit... and that's specially comic in his duet with Helen of Troy. On the other hand Samuel R. deserves an Oscar! and Gabriela B. is also a good actress...Just buy it an enjoy!
__label__2 Fresh insight and observation: I am re-reading "Buck Naked Faith" now, and I am just as engaged as the first time. I find myself saying, "Yeah, that's right" or "Humph" often because Sandras crystallizes age old (and new) spiritual insight on subjects often thought about by many.I recommend this book for just about any person over the age of about thirteen or fourteen. There are some adult situations discussed, but nothing gratuitous.You will be challenged when you read this book.
__label__1 You must be bleeping kidding me...: Anyone who even has a basic understanding of quantum physics knows that most of this film is an extreme misrepresentation of the truth. The fact that this film claims to have experts in these fields is ridiculous. Just look at who most of the speakers are. These people have an agenda, and it is not a purely scientific one. Simply put, the film is propaganda in its basest form, working for some metaphysical pseudoscience. Real scientists are certainly rolling on the floor laughing at this joke of a film.
__label__2 awesome device: The kindle is the best birthday present I ever got. I love reading, so I fell in love with it from the start. It is absolutely useful for school,(by the way, I'm her son)I use it for reading groups. I highly reccomend this to anyone who even minorly likes reading. And I conclude this reveiw
__label__1 Waste of Money: As someone said, this does have it's problems. It falls over easily. Ours just turns on whenever it feels like it. My son says it's "haunted". The blast of static has happened over & over on it. It has woken the baby up several times. We've even gotten phone call conversations on it and they weren't from our phone! I could here voices coming out of my daughter's nursery, it was scary! The clicking noise is annoying on the receiver. The projector works but only if strapped to the baby's head so the picture comes out clearly. Save your money, not worth the cash.
__label__2 Wonderful Flavors but watch for editing mistakes: I return to this book over and over again as the recipes have delicious flavor!However, I have found numerous mistakes that should have been caught during recipe testing before going to print. For example, the process for rehydrating masa harina in the recipes for tamales will produce unedible dough. (not enough water) Of course, the recipes were written for fresh masa, but this should have been caught in the testing process.Another recipe that flopped was for Alegrias (Mexican Amaranth Candy). In Mexico, amaranth is typically available in the pre-puffed state. However, in the US it is typically unpuffed. (found this out in another recipe disaster) The recipe worked perfectly when I used the pre-puffed Mexican amaranth.When the recipes work, they are spectacular! Just be watchful!
__label__2 even better than I remembered: I hadn't heard this record in about 15 years when I recently picked up the CD (Captain Oi version). What a great record! Total punk rock but with real R&R; roots. The band is so tight, the songs are great and Nicky Garratt's killing it on guitar. His favorite guitarist is Richie Blackmore and I just noticed how a lot Nicky's solos start off kinda like "Speed King" or "Highway Star" on this record. Killer! That's probably a turn off to some punks, but that's life.Check out Mighty High...In Drug City.
__label__1 VERY POOR: B-MOVIE COMPARABLE TO THE WORSE OF COLD WAR HOLLYWOOD PROPAGANDA. STIFF ACTING REMINISCENT OF 1920 ERA MOVIES.FAIR ATTEMPT AT DISGUISING T-34'S FOR TIGER I TANKS. BEST EXAMPLES IN CLOSEUP SCENES.NOT RECOMMENDED.
__label__2 One of the best movies of 1998: I do not see why most people downgrade this movie so much. To me the movie was nonstop action from beginning to end. The special effects were great and interesting and I thought the story line was also interesting and easy to follow. Even if the movie was not that good it was definitly better than most other movies that came out in 1998. It was even better than Armageddon and Deep Impact.
__label__1 The only mystery is how this film isn't in the $5 bin at Wal mart, and it's one not worth solving: Not even the likes of Wes CravenCould save this film from bad movie haven"Cursed" and "Shocker"- those were awfulBut this one's so bad, it should be unlawfulIt amazes me how people could be suckered inBy a movie that should be in the bargain binEven the 3D, with picture so flatWill make you say "enough of THAT"The mystery surrounding a small town killeris what is the plot of this cringe-worthy thrillerAnd especially the characters, which we've seen beforeAdd to this movie being a flat out boreThe dialogue is awful, the acting just sucksYou'll await the end of this waste of hard-earned bucksAnd even the twist, which is just a guessing gameIs predictable as hell, and flat out lameBoring, depressing, unworthy and dullYou'd be better off staring at the nearest wallLet's hope Wes can improve with Scream 4Which hopefully will be good and not such a bore
__label__2 Great for the Price: The club is great for being under $40. The only reason I gave it a 4 star rating is do to the grip on the club but its easily fixed by wearing a glove. Took it to the driving range and was easily hitting 250-275 yards.
__label__1 Not good: Not what was expected.I have had heaps of trouble since I ordered this item - really needs more info.I do not proclaim that I am an expert on CB, but i have had problems from day one...
__label__1 So so...: Easy to read. Pretty Pics...but I thought it was a waste of my money. Have gotten better ideas from one magazine than this entire book. Go to the library to check it out & save your money.
__label__1 Poor: As previous reviewers mentioned, there were many errors in this book. Furthermore, it was an extremely unrigorous treatment, with many redundant examples and filler text. It was also scrupulously politically correct, with many pages devoted to "You're not going to fail this course if you're female or a minority". The same tone of self-important liberalism reappears throughout the text.There are definitely better books out there.
__label__1 Didn't really seem like he was trying...: I'm a fan of most of Palahanuk's books, they are entertaining, thought provoking and original if nothing else. This book was none of those things, it was almost a parody of palahanuk's style. It was pointlessly gross, pointlessly boring, and mostly just pointless. I think he's getting lazy, I know he can do better then this mess.
__label__2 Jury is still out on this brand....: This brand has an oilier feel and takes longer to soak into my skin than another brand I have used in past, but this one costs less. So the saying may be true..."you get what you pay for."Anyway, once the oil soaks into my skin it then feels incredibly soft and that is a huge plus especially when dealing with hard water. Let me tell you that hard water is "Killer" on the skin....So on that note, 4 out of 5 stars is more than adequate.
__label__2 Nice affordable rack: This rack gets the job done. I mostly use it for local trips (under 10 miles) so I can't speak to its performance over long distances, but for what I do it's perfect.Getting it set up each time can be a bit tedious, and the center rack-to-bike strap usually comes loose, but other than that no real complaints. It scratched up my trunk paint the first time I used it because I didn't offset it from the car enough, definitely be careful about that.Considering the price of most bike racks out there, this is a VERY good buy for your money at less than half the price of others.
__label__2 Great book,but...: I REALLY like this book.It's really good.Except, I always thought Christina was too tall to be a jockey.I thought she hated racing.I thought she eventing with Sterling.Now,she all of sudden shrunk too jockey hight or something.Now she loves racing and dumped both eventing and Sterling for it.Also,since when are Townsend Acres colors red and black.I believe they green and gold.Hey, new author,get a clue and quit ruining the series. This series all inconsistent now because Joanna Campbell lost her mind and quit writing the books herself.Oh well,the book's overall content was good,but some of facts got a little twisted around.P.S. where are dylan and katie?
__label__1 I'm sure these would grow if...: ...the seeds were fresh. I usually have no trouble with this particular brand, but am very disappointed with the packet I got. It was packed for 2009, so maybe that has something to do with it. But then, seeds are usually viable for a couple of years....so....?
__label__1 out in the sun too long: too much California sun had fried their creativity while they recorded this!It is shallow, weak, derivitive and a long way below the creative genius they displayed on Crime of the Century (their only album worth having)The irony is their commercial success was inversely related to their musical peak.
__label__2 heck yeah!: LONG- works great, I'm using this with a HDMI 4 port splitter! From my computer I have run lines to my downstairs HDMI TV in the family room, and to my HDMI 3D TV up in the living room. I also run a HDMI 3rd monitor on my computer. These work well - audio and video.
__label__1 Poor: Ok i had this thing for all of 1 week and i liked it for a few days but then the earphone port broke and i was a little pissed so i tried to return it and no one contacted me so 1 thing after another the battery started acting up it would turn on and turn off i give this thing a 2 outta 10 dont buy it at all costumer service is really poor
__label__2 Should be zero stars!!!!: Received this item just over 1 month ago. Worked fine out of the box but no just makes a grinding noise when trying to reel in a mere 50ft length of hose. Has been used very lightly by an adult. I am now outside of the Amazon return window by 2 weeks. Don't waste your money on this piece of garbage.Update- I was able to contact customer service at Suncast and was very pleased with the service. I described the problem and received parts and schematic within 2 days. I needed to call customer service back and was able to deal with the same person- Laura- who spoke perfect English, not an offshore call center. After replacement parts reel works perfectly again. I am revising up to 4 stars. I have been generally very pleased with my other Suncast products and feel I can easily get support again if I have any more problems.
__label__1 Painful to endure.: Gosh, this film was bad. It was as if the actors were told to pour out their guts in wrenching circumstances for as long as they could without a script to keep them in line. The result, a long, long exercise in self pity & depression.Was anything good about it? Yes, I did like Jason Robards' & Philip Seymour Hoffman's parts; played honestly without excessive blubbering. The rest of it should be locked and showed only as a penalty for moving violations.
__label__1 Over Priced/Over Valued: Got this machine this past year and with alot of discounts paid around $42. Never put in dish washer. The top lid did not hold up after a few weeks,which makes it tricky to turn over when finished. One fall resulted in a side tab breaking that holds the unit on the base. This could be "operators" error but the plastic tab is not very strong for the long haul. And its hard to get a large batch as they recommend a 3rd cup. Overall, its nice looking and I thought it would do a good job...I gave up on air poppers and will try the Stir Crazy. (Orville Redenbacker has a similar unit and it was $19.00 during Black Friday) Lots of money for a below average popper.
__label__1 spends more time trashing scientists than discussing animals: I was really disappointed in this book. No reasonable scientist today denies that many animals have emotions, thoughts, and consciousness; unfortunately, this book spends too much time trashing scientists and not enough time on its main topic.
__label__2 INSPIRING!!!: I LOVE this book. I've been knitting for over 30 years, but still love the designs in here, particularly the Einstein sweater/coat which can take on so many looks, depending on the yarn. I'm looking forward to doing several of the items in here with handpainted yarns. Simple, straightforward, good pictures for new knitters, and terrific designs. I can't wait for the next one in the series.
__label__2 Sometimes basic is best: The humble W59 is compact, light as a feather, unobtrusive and ultra-comfortable, yet totally functional, good looking, and robust. Its design has endured unchanged for many years. The three-button ergonomics and simple, easy flow and control of functions has been long-perfected. The alarm is loud and the LED illumination works well. It is hard to think of how this watch could be improved. The W59 is quite similar to the world-famous, super basic F-91, but with a 50M water rating and (I think) a slightly more appealing aesthetic.I respect Casio for making these affordable watches so well - it demonstrates the organization's respect for its customers, regardless of how much they choose to pay for a watch. Anyone should be able to make a good watch if given several hundred dollars, right? But to sell something for under $20 bucks that is durable, attractive, accurate, tough, well made, and high quality? Excellent.
__label__2 WELL PUT TOGETHER RESOURCE: A great resource to learn what many of the famous saints of the Catholic Church had to say about various topics and issues.Well worth the having. Good resource for homilies or spiritual presentations or spiritual comfort and enlightenment.
__label__2 Decent screen with few flaws: OK I am a first time projector guy (choose optoma HD20) and I was looking for a reasonably priced screen for my loft. I came across this screen and it has a good price point and reviews.Pros:* Good price for the size.* The Elite screens website has good information on dimensions etc, with that you can do pricese mount.* The back of the screen has black lining which is very important for drakening when mounted over a window.Cons:* There are small wrinkles on the screen, when you are watching CNN or CNBC where at the bottom letters scroll, you can see them riding on a wave in few places.* They should sold the L brackets with the screen, additional $30 (from [...]) is not acceptable. I can see most people would be mounting using the L brackets over a window etc.Overall I like this screen but with some minor disappointments.
__label__1 I Just Don't Understand why people like it: Being a lover of fantasy books, I had heard this was a great series, and so I looked forward to reading it. I read this book from cover to cover. I kept waiting for it to get better, but it never really did. To me, it was tedious and boring. One of the things I love about any kind of story is great characters, even if there are only a few. I want to care about these characters and in this book, I just didn't. I won't go into detail about the plot; you can read other reviews or summations, but suffice it to say that had the story been more interesting, than I might have wanted to continue reading the series, hoping the characters would develop.And yes, the detail is just too much, but I have enjoyed other books with this problem because you can sometimes just skim over these parts and get to the good stuff.Perhaps in the later books, the plot and characters become better, but this book was so boring I just can't bring myself to pick up another one.
__label__2 Beautiful Parody: If you ever read the classic "Gullivers Travels" by Jonathan Swift, this exotic comic version by Milo Manara is sure to make you laugh. The story here focuses on a beautifull female who like Gulliver, goes into "other worlds" so to speak, and meets lilliputs, then giants, and other creations that Manara includes himself. The story is funny and Manara finds plenty of reason for the Girl to take off her clothes. However if your looking for a very explicit sex story, then look somewhere else...this story is very nicely drawn, not sickly perverted, and is very funny, making this an excellent parody of the original classic!
__label__1 Appalling story: Contains SPOILERS - but never mind. The story is already rotten to the core.This is a appalling story. The basic story line is that the decades-old skeleton of a baby is found in the wall of an old building. It turned out that the baby had died in an accident due to the negligence of his older siblings, who fearing the consequences, stuffed the body into the wall of a building under construction. Such despicable behavior by young and frightened children can perhaps be understood, but it turns out that an adult also knew of it, and yet said nothing, allowing the baby's parents to go grieving to their graves never knowing what had happened to him. Sick, sick, sick! Call this a cozy? It's pure horror.
__label__1 new dvd: Warner Bros.! Please release Bladerunner in 5.1 Dolby and 2.0 Dolby surround. what's the point of making a DVD if it's not going to have the quality of a DVD? That's the whole reason in buying them.
__label__1 mediocre story, dull writing: Beware the hype on this one. The story itself is OK, and is just about interesting enough to get you through to the end, but the characters are irritating beyond belief and the tone of the whole thing is unremittingly earnest. I didn't so much as smirk while reading this. As a portrayal of posh kids in London it's not too far off the mark, but I can't be more generous than that. The publishers will have you believe they've discovered a major new talent - they haven't.
__label__2 Beautiful!: I ordered this for my father to replace his old guardian angel on his motorcycle. And since we are Catholic it just seemed to fit! It is absolutely beautiful, and still looks like new even though it is hanging from his motorcycle. I definately reccomend this product!
__label__1 Dont Waste your Money: This Season I think started the downhill fall for the Comedy Series King of Queens. This season had some of the dumbest and most boring episodes ever. Doug and Carrie argue WAYYYYY to much now and its hurtful arguing and not funny, stuppid arguing. Deacon rarely shows up and I miss that! :(. So what I basically trying to say is that this Season is not very good. Thats just my opinion
__label__2 A Must Read Book: All book readers must read "The Year of the Hangman", by Gary Blackwood. It takes history and gives it a twist. Throughout the book the phrase "This didn't happend, but it could have", appears in your head.Crieghton is a boy from England who is taken away to live in the colony's. He is captured when his boat is ambushed and is sent to live with Ben Franklin in New Orleans. Crieghton slowly switches sides from Tory to colonist. At the end he is still loyal to the king, but creighton has grown acustomed to the colonys and stays there."The Year of the Hangman" featues George Washington, Benidict Arnold, and Benjiman Franklin. You must read it to find out what happend.
__label__2 Take My Hand Wedding CD: This was a life-saver! I'm marrying the pastor and we are the only two organists in our church! Packaged well, arrived undamaged, and when expected. Plays beautifully. Item and seller recommended.!!
__label__1 Disappointed: I bought this clock in March for the projection feature so my husband wouldn't have to sit up to see the clock which is on my side. It worked great in the beginning. Soon I noticed the PM wasn't displaying in the projection then the 1st number stopped displaying so 11:00 displayed as 1:00. Now the second number is out also so the feature I bought it for is useless. I contacted the company and they are willing to replace it but I have to pay to return the broken clock. Don't know if it will be worth it based on other reviews. I wish I had read them first before buying this clock.
__label__1 Daft Album...Literally: I was really disappinted with this album because I'd bought discovery before this one and it was a great funky cd.Now,my theory is that the 1st album of every artist ever, is always their best..Boy was I wrong...and a half!Homework absoloutly squashed that idea completely! After hearing the classic 'Around The World'(in my opinion their best song ever) i thought the album would reflect this. As soon as i heard the beginning track 'dafizetrse' or watever its called, i had an instinct that the album would suck..and it did. Don't bother with this album, the only 3 good songs (out of 16 tracks) are Around The World,Teachers and Oh Yeah. The rest are just noise. So, in a nutshell, this album stinks worse than a hobo, get discovery instead.
__label__2 Great product!: I got this for my husband's office as he is a CPA and he put me in charge of finding him a good 10-key! He used this during tax-season and loved it! A great product with a great price.
__label__1 Bad attitude: While this book contains some useful information, much of it is outdated. Further, I was saddened to see how self-absorbed and negative it was. Much of the book seems to indicate the author feels fatherhood is a life sentence of drudgery. Considerable mention is made of the death of one's former freedom-loving existence, and how a baby will inconvenience one's life. I purchased this book based on the number of glowing reviews and was disappointed with the book's negative additude toward fatherhood.
__label__1 Automatic shutoff - not!: I purchased this kettle for our office, and quickly found that it does not automatically shut off and stay off after the water is hot, contrary to the product description. Instead, it cycles until it boils dry, or someone notices and manually turns it off. Even the manual turn-off option is dicey, as there is nothing to indicate whether off is "lever up" or "lever down". I would not purchase this kettle again.
__label__2 A book that everyone should read at some point in their life: "Rich in Love" was assigned to me to read as a high school senior. I found that the book develops through the chapters into a meanful tale about one's struggle with love. The main character's idea of love grows and changes through the novel allowing the reader to understand the adolescent feelings of love.
__label__1 Kids love parents don't: The track did not assemble as it should. The parts didn't fit right and caused the whole track to be off. Several people tried putting it together so this is not one person's opinion but several. Kids loved it even though it didn,t stay together well and the cars didn't stay on the track.
__label__2 Simple Intro to Improving Your Soil!: Very simple method to improve the quality of your garden soil, predominantly by recycling materials from your home and yard. Takes some practice, but if you follow instructions, you will be rewarded with "black gold"!
__label__1 CHEAP QUALITY: Worst tie rack ever. It broke in 1 hour. It really isn't durable enough to hold a bunch of ties. I would spend a bit more money and get something better.
__label__1 Pretentious noodling from a musical poseur: If you loved the film (I personally hated it) then you probably loved this pretentious claptrap from Michael Nyman and my comments will anger you. But really, even aside from the absurdly anachronistic relationship of the musical style to the time period depicted in the film, this music has little to recommend it. New-agey fluff, harmonically and melodically pointless, this quasi-improvisatory doodling conjures up images of Keith Jarrett ( no offense to that great keyboard master) recovering from a frontal lobotomy. The chord progressions don't make sense and the "melodies" wander aimlessly and end arbitrarily. If you just like the sound of a piano but don't care what actual notes are played, you might be able to stand this.Otherwise, give it a wide berth.Not recommended, even to my enemies.
__label__2 Music to watch movies to: HOLY EFFING CRAP!!! This is an excellent cd. I love FBTMOF because every cd is different. Therefore, it's hard to pick a favorite because each cd has it's own personality. But I would say this is the best place to start out if you've never heard FBTMOF before. Highly recommended.
__label__2 Sandra's first album!: On 25th October 1979, this album was released in Japan... Now re-issued as CD, it features the original artwork on he cover and the back cover (booklet)... The most beautiful tracks are: "Dancing In The Fire Of Love", "City Cats", "Hell Driver", "Don't Kiss A Crocodile" and "Plastic Heart"... Sandra was only 17 in the photos of this album, and she just joined the trio when they recorded it... A must for any Sandra fan!
__label__1 Poorest war movie ever made: 'Midway' on DVD while we're still waiting for 'The Longest Day'- somebody's got to be kidding. This one really sucks. Here we go: stock-shots ripped off from 'Thirty seconds over Tokyo', 'Tora Tora Tora' and probably other movies, WWII newsreels footage extensively cropped to fit into the Panavision frame, meaningless cameos by various aging stars -probably to make the flick look like a blockbuster- , historical mistakes and countless errors about planes and aircraft carriers, inept dramatization -the predictable romance between Heston's son and a Japanese girl-, you name it. The only reason I give this awful turkey one star is because the software doesn't allow me to give it none.
__label__1 Not impressed: I wasn't really impressed with this dart board. It did everything it said it would, but i wasn't impressed by the way the darts hit the board. I should have spent more money to get a better one.
__label__1 Horrendous Picture and Sound Quality: I love the KOMMISSAR X movies and was eagerly awaiting the DVD. Unfortunately, this was pressed from the perhaps the worst master Sinister Cinema could find. The film is scratched, dirty, out-of-focus, and apparently was edited with a pair of scissors by someone with palsy, then reassembled with Elmers glue. Do not buy this DVD. You will be throwing your money away. Somewhere out there is a decent print of DEATH TRIP. This is definitely not it. Sinister Cinema should be ashamed of themselves for releasing this print.
__label__2 Love my Kindle 1, Want a Kindle 2... but...: I am an avid fan of Kindle 1 and would like to purchase a Kindle 2. However, I was hoping there would be some incentive for the owners of the original Kindle to upgrade through a partial trade in or discount offer especially since the purchase of Kindle 2 will replace the use of Kindle 1 for most of us.As original Kindle owners we provided essential feedback that influenced the development of Kindle 2. We also were instrumental in word of mouth advertising for the product. We also paid a high price for the Kindle 1 which does only a fraction of what the upgrade does.I'm sure many Kindle 1 owners would like to remain loyal customers but at the cost of nearly another $400, may not be able to buy a second Kindle.Surely Amazon must appreciate the users and customers who have been their strongest advocates and providers of feedback. Why not give them an incentive to buy the Kindle 2?
__label__2 So in the Zone: Just listen this album, u'll like. I believe in her.She has broken her leg, she is a really working girl, don't talk bad if u didn't hear this record.
__label__1 The gospel according to Oprah: This book is garbage, a total waste of time and money. There is nothing here of any real substance. It is just more of the current crop of " new age" baloney being touted by celebrities such as Oprah Winfrey.I am an avid book lover and collector, but this one went in the trash can, which is where it belongs.
__label__1 What For!!: This D-Link ant did nothing for me. I use it to try to get a better signal on Clear Modem. Think 7db is more like no db. There just was no gain for me. I return it back to Amazon.
__label__1 X -tremely Bad: Jason in space?. Come on people!. That tells you something right there!. This is a movie that is a horrid attempt at bringing back the 80's slasher craze. It was fun, sure, but it just doesn't hold any water these days. This movie was excruciatingly awful. As bad as they come. The kills were okay, but there were too many and they happened too fast. The movie had horrible pacing. The director obviously had no clues on that subject. It was a mess and the film itself looked like a botched science experiment. Jason should've stayed dead. Very,very bad.
__label__1 questions: does anyone know if the charge that came with is usable in europe or asia?and wat is the sliding piece on the charger for?
__label__1 Errorful: I wonder if anyone tried to edit this book. You would think that after 86 years of no championships, this book would be flawless. O well, at least the Boston Globe tried and I'm sure the ring is more important than a book to Red Sox fans.
__label__1 don't waste your time: this movie completely sucks. don't waste your time with this movie because basically there is no plot the characters are poorly written and the acting is extremely bad. i had expected better from rob zombie. the only good thing about this movie is the gore but even that way to over done. this is one movie i got up and walked out of halfway threw it. so please don't waste your time.
__label__2 If you dont have it you haven't lived!!!!!!!: A must have. Headlined by "We're not gonna take it" and, my personnal favorite, "I wanna rock." Delivers raw intense metal, which well defines the mid 80's rock scene.
__label__2 Worked as advertised, never had one break: Worked perfectly, have never had one break, seem stronger than most bits. Using metal to metal is machining: slow, steady patience is rewarded. I use a variable speed drill, very slow, and a rig to hold it steady. These worked perfect to remove a hardened steel bolt buried half an inch into a engine block. Stuffed hole with paraffin, used torch to heat up the bolt and the surrounding metal so the paraffin wicks into the threads, repeat two or three times, bolt eased out perfect.
__label__1 Good idea, but not for grays at temple: So I'm starting to have silver hair at my temples, which drives me crazy. They are very thin hairs. This is a giant waxy crayon that you wet and rub on the gray hairs, but for my temples that means the skin under the hairs also turns orange - a dead give-away that it's been colored. Also it's a light orange, so it's not quite bright silver but it definitely doesn't math my auburn hair. I tried rubbing it on my fingers and then just running my fingers over the hairs directly but it didn't cover the silver at all that way. So this is not for me. Maybe it's better for parts near the back of the head.
__label__2 Regina Spektor: Regina Spektor, is a fantastic songwriter and singer. She has such a unique style that has just captivated me. This CD is certainly worth the extra few dollars for the extra tracks> I even had teh other Begin to Hope and had to replace it for those tracks. Good buy on my part.
__label__2 Buy the extension cable for the antenna.: If you plan to buy this and cannot mount the antenna outside, forget it. I tried it in two windows with no luck. I ended up having to run the wire throught the window and outside, it looks ugly for now but it works great. When I receive the extension I plan to run it alongside my TV cable wire and around the foundation of the house. Great sound when connected to my home stereo system. Between the car, the home dock, and the internet radio-I think I end up listening to Sirius about 6-8 hours a day. I don't think it will ever get old either.
__label__1 There nothing lower than one star?: Wow, just caught the last 20 minutes of this with my in-laws, and my god...it's terrible. Just when you start to really notice how bad the script is, you realize how awful every aspect of the film is. It's lit like a supermarket dairy aisle. The actors took notes from telemundo. The lead female character is apparently a doctor/preacher/bad mom? I don't know. I got kind of bored and started making up my own story.Cheryl Ladd though...she's still got it.
__label__2 good product, but not durable: It worked well, while it lasted, with in 3-4 months one of the speakers stopped working.no very durable.
__label__1 Mistake in product number identification?: The quality of this Braun replacement appears to be fine. However, it DOES NOT work with the Braun KFK10 product that I have. Is there some other designation that could be added so that one understands that it is NOT universal, does not fit all KFK10 models
__label__1 Saw II DVD: i was very disappointed that the movie did not have a cover and i bought a brand new copy of it
__label__2 Basil Rathbone rules !!: This is the best of the best. If you are a Sherlock Holmes fan and don't own this dvd what are you waiting for !! This movie is still as entertaining as the the first time I saw it. Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce are the best. George Zucco as Professor Moriarity is a classic villan. " Enjoy ".
__label__2 Nice and solid: I am very happy with the mixer - I did a fair amount of baking over the holidays and it was a pleasure to turn it on every time. Solid mechanics and structure. I was a little concerned that when folding some very dry dough (I was short a couple tablespoons of extract), it seemed to be clunky. I know it says that if the beaters should hit the side you can adjust it, but I want something at this price point to be without flaw. That's why I didn't give it 5 stars.
__label__1 mickey & minnie night light: Guess sometimes you get what you pay for. Its cute. But, doesn't stay on. The switch is defective somehow. I had to rig mine to get it to stay on. Came with a bulb so I thought that was pretty cool!
__label__2 Much cheaper through Amazon! Will purchase again!: This product is fabulous! I feed my pups grain free and this fits the bill. It seems to be very tasty according to my bulldogs and makes training very easy. The pieces are pretty soft and can be broken up into smaller pieces, perfect for training. I highly recommend going through amazon to get this. If you have prime and get free shipping, it's worth it because it's $5 more in pet stores.I wouldn't feed Wellness food, I get better stuff, but the treats are great and fit my needs in training stubborn bulldogs.
__label__1 Not very good information for an experienced designer: This book misses a lot of the knowledge required to effectively use CATIA v5. Also,there are many blatant errors, not only in grammer,spelling, and graphic examples, but especially in the learning examples. A lot of your time will be wasted trying to follow the books instructions for they are inaccurate. Best to wait for a much better book, one with some intelligence behind it, to come along.It is evident that this book was written by an inexperienced author, and was not proof-read or checked for accuracy.
__label__2 Great book on Remoting: No book currently out has as much quality material on .NET Remoting. This book really helped me understand this technology. While some material on Web Services is duplicated, the Remoting material alone makes the book a good buy.
__label__2 Excellent aftermarket heatsink and fan: This fan and heatsink is really excellent, keeps my Q6660 AT 36C idle and around 55C under load. Installation was fairly simple although getting the clip took some time since once you screw in one end the other was extremely hard to get in. Screwing in the first part only a little then doing the other and tightening after solved it. Excellent product overall, planning on OC'ing a bit now that I got rid of the stock heatsink.
__label__1 bad: sean connery is the tru james bond.& brecking up the bond set suck's.because I want to buy on her majesty's secret service but I want sean connery.
__label__2 Read it.: This beautifully written book was a joy to read. It is really series of stories that are wonderfully woven together. I'd especially recommend this to anyone interested in India and its traditions
__label__1 Replaces humor and insight of past CDs with self-indulgence: I was disappointed. None of the play that was obvious in any of the other 3 CDs seems to be in this release. It's a "think too hard" kind of album. I don't mind thinking, but I don't like overthinking. The issues (rejection as a child, etc.) don't seem that different than the last releases, but the sense of humor about them has grown into dark obsession. Maybe I'll get into it, but I doubt I'll like it better than "Sgt. Pepper." I can almost say that about the first CD and "Whatever and Ever Amen," though. Oh well . . . he never promised me a rose garden.
__label__2 Awesome!: I don't have this game, but my uncle does. It is the most awesome game ever. I like the create a wrestler mode. My uncle created Rey Mysterio Jr. Anyway, this game has tons of wrestlers(too bad they don't have Goldberg), tons diffrent modes and stunning graphics. Buy this game!
__label__2 Christmas Joy: Beautiful in step with the softness of the season.If you have not purchased A Christmas album in a while this is the one.C.Domhan
__label__1 Expected more from a Nikon: Too slow when using flash. bad pictures when outside during the evening. Flash is weak. Good panoramic feature though.
__label__1 Book Ruined By Poor Formatting: I picked this book up when it was offered as a freebie and I'm glad I didn't pay for it. The plot is not bad, but I was put off by the annoying way the author formatted the book. Instead of using italics, as is the norm, whenever a person speaks he prefaces statements with the em (-) mark. At times I had difficulty distinguishing between narration, thoughts and spoken words. As I read on this became such a distraction that gave up on the book.
__label__1 Very little to do with care or the soul.: You better know your Greek mythology, and be prepared to get lost in detailed abstraction if you want to read this one! I found this to be a drudge to get through. Moore never defines "soul", but says something like everyone knows when a person has soul: She's got soul. What does that mean??? Very little is defined in this book, and there are no footnotes where there should be!! I found this to be a hollow book, promising much and delivering little. I didn't even bother to pick up "Soul Mates". What Dorothy Parker supposedly said about a novel is also true of this book. It is not "to be tossed aside lightly. It should be thrown with great force".
__label__2 Great sequel: Nidemon being the middle book in the trilogy, was a great sequay from the 1st book. The story line is consist with the first and even though I got is a year or two after the first, all I had to do was reread the last two chapters of the first to get up to date. Very enjoyable and I look forward to the 3rd book.
__label__1 worked for a couple of days: We had purchased these intercoms in the past for use in our home to office about 50 yards away, so i was not too worried when the first set arrived and threw away the packaging. They worked as they always had in the past for a couple of days and then just quit. i thought there might just be something wrong with that set so i ordered another set and sent the other set back in the new packaging. The new set, like the other, worked for a couple of days and now have stopped working as well. Guess i'm stuck with these. i don't know why they would work for a couple of days then quit, but they have changed something as they do not work like they use too. After getting 2 sets in a row that quit working while still brand new i would reccommend you avoid buying these.
__label__1 Now what is this crap?!: That's exactly what I thought when I first saw this: "Now what is this crap?" ANOTHER documentary? Nothing worth mentioning has happened since the last one. The Ozzy camp trying to out-KISS KISS now with all the redunant products? And the NAME! Just pure ridiculousness all the way around.
__label__2 Very Good Stylus/Pen: This is an excellent stylus/pen combination. I bought this exact item from a store near where I live, and have had it for several weeks. It is durable, easy to switch between pens and a stylus. My only complaint is that it slips out of your hand after a long period of use, but it's excellent for usual use. I'm going to order another one for my visor!
__label__1 Does it really do what it says?: I got Net Nanny to test and see whether it really blocks "surprises" from teen and children. So, I set up the account with restricted access to the internet. The level was about 75% restricted. When I opened some sites, it was a surprise indeed. I was able to open Playboy.com with ease and navigate. On the other hand, my research group website was blocked and so was The Economist website!!I am sure there are pop-ups and links on websites which can lead a child to sites like Playboy. They DO have the option of adding websites to their "restricted websites" page but Net Nanny has not done her homework if a well-known site like playboy is not blocked!! I wonder what other websites remain to be blocked.(...)
__label__1 Useless: Not a good buy. Full of trivial info. Looks like I paid for only 10-12 pointers I picked up from this thick book. This book is probably useful for HP UX System admins, but that too is limited to first 2-3 chap.OReilley's book on System Admin is a better choice with some HP manuals.
__label__1 crap movie: this tv show or movie sucks. I tried watching it again like I did when I was younger but no this just sucks.
__label__2 great topic...: Really good read - such an interesting discussion topic. A few things could've been done better or clearer - like her daughter not asking many questions esp. when meeting her grandmother. But overall - very well written and compelling.
__label__2 I can't stop thinking about Rat, Forrest and Tuck: I can't stop thinking about the characters in this book! And they aren't just people, theres ravens too! Also a castle with drawbridges and a moat that smells really bad. But the best thing about this book is the way the author makes you feel as if you're right there back in time! I really loved Forrest and Maddy, My favorite was Rat and I was worried about all of them when they tried to escape. I loved how you were on the edge of your seat, wondering what was going to happen next. I've never been to England, but I feel as if I've been to the Tower of London after reading this book.It was a scary, exciting, and best of all fun. It's now my all time favorite book.
__label__1 Will fail you in the end...: I own this printer. I loved the quality of the prints. That's the only good thing I can say. Replacing the ink is very costly & this printer goes through lot's of ink quickly. This printer gets frequent clogged print heads. After about a yr or 2 of use expect to decide if u want pay lots of $ for a new printhead. Google for the i9900 printhead, & u will see many chats of people who have had printhead issues w/ this printer. Don't buy this thing. It will end up costing u more than it's worth!
__label__1 HEY!! WHERE'S THE WORKBOOK??: Just purchased this video, began to watch it, and realized that it requires the "Learn Math Quickly" workbook. This workbook is not offered by (this site). Without the workbook, the video is useless as the video's instructor asks the viewer repeatedly to refer to it and perform tasks in it. Could be worth more than one star, but I guess I'll never know!!
__label__1 Who`s she working for?: This jewish author is obviously working for rich powerful evil men in high up places who run illegal establishments for themselves and their rich millionaire buddies. So now when a child comes forward and says that they were abused by a rich famous person, the offender can now get off because the offender can claim this "false" memory garbage. Wake up people and don`t be fooled by this woman and her lies. She`s protecting evil men in high up places. This woman author is also a skeptic. But she wasn`t skeptical of the people who claimed that John Demjanjuk was Ivan The Terrible.
__label__1 Poor Quality Docking Station: The quality of this product is poor. I wanted something inexpensive for my 8-year-old, but even my 8-year-old son deserved a better sound quality docking station.
__label__1 No way!!: If you're not a Firehouse fan and buy this album, you'll be angry.If you're a Firehouse fan, you'll be disappointed.That's it.
__label__2 never received: I finally went to Hallmark and bought it there - it was a gift for my mother - but I read it first and it's a very dear little book.
__label__1 yuck!: This was one of the worst books I've ever read. The author lucked into a cute title and an interesting cover design, which is probably what helped the book sell at all. But the characters are boring, the story is weak, and it's pretty obvious that no one associated with the book has ever visited Portland. When I picked it up, the first thing I noticed was how large the type was -- apparently they didn't have enough story to fill all the pages in a normal font size? Then I started reading and was completely turned off by the sleazy main character. I can't remember any of her boring friends in detail, but it was so obvious that she was going to end up with the dentist, I can't believe I even bothered to finish the book. But, since it really was only about half a book to start with, it didn't take very long to finish. My recommendation -- don't bother!
__label__1 VERY DISAPPOINTING: I am so disappointed with this book. While the pictures arenice, the text is largely useless. You can not learn fromthis book. Instead, the author simply tells you one thingafter another with hardly any motivation and rarely givingan explanation that lets you know what is going on. If youwant a book that you thumb through now and then, look atsome nice pictures, have a few jargony words thrown yourway, then you might like this. But if you want a book thatgives you a real glimpse of modern physics and gives you somereal insight into what is happening at the cutting edge and why,then this book will leave you as disappointed as I am.
__label__1 Nothing New!: In my opinion, this film its no scary. Dark Castle Enterainment produce this film, and also produce The House on Haunted Hill, so both films are allmost the same. This one, is more boring, because it doesnt make you belive that the things that happen are "true". The music its not good, and maybe the sounds are scary. I think the story is good, but they dont make a good film.
__label__2 AR AW-811 Outdoor Wireless Speaker Review: I needed an outdoor speaker so I could play our CD collection on our Sony Megachanger outside. The AW-811 does everything it's advertised to do. I hooked the transmitting antenna to the headset output of our stereo receiver and the speaker plays just fine outside about 30 feet away. It has good tone and a fair base, and was about $30.00 cheaper than Circuit City. Works for me.
__label__2 thank you for speedy reaction: I am in Japan.I am sutisfied with this product and parchase.thank you !
__label__1 leaking spout: I bought this watering can because it said that it didn't leak and has a fine rose sprinkler. Well it leaks like a sieve and the sprinkler is not fine. It pours so much water out that it pushes the soil out of the pot and exposes the plant roots. I would NOT recommend this product for using on delicate plants. It is not worth the money. Save yourself the trouble and buy a different watering can.
__label__1 Ugh!: Well, MTX has always been great, until Alcatraz. The Sound is just so much different, it's almost painful to listen to. Dr. Frank has to work on his vocals.
__label__2 Savage Garden's "I Knew I Loved You": I love this CD! I especially like the acoustic version. The song is so pure, beautiful, and romantic. I simply fell in love with it the 1st time I heard it. Buy it!
__label__1 Actually i'd rather give this piece of crap zero stars.: this book is too graphic. and the begining is so confusing. there's too many characters. and does the author reallly expect us to, after reading this stupid book, make a friggin quail in rose petal sauce. first of all i don't believe in eating animals that represent pets and second of all, i don't eat flowers. and do we really want to hear about her nipples hardening in the cold shower. no not really. and lastly i don't think this book is worth ten dollars and while borrowing this piece of trash, i lost it while taking the stupid STAR test and i now owe my teacher ten dollars, or a new book. and another thing: why would any sane woman let a dirty pigeon poop all over her, or eat candles and blow up with her boy friend stupid people.
__label__2 Best show that got cancelled: This show was made before 9-11 about a post 9-11 world. It deals with USA in a depression after terrorist sent up a nucular air pulse that killed all the computers and sent the world back to the dark ages. With crime running out of control our hero Max (the lovely Jessica Alba) is a geniticly enhanced super soilder who escaped from her test lab prison. I still can not forgive Foxfor cancelling this show. BAD FOX! BAD FOX!
__label__2 Good collection: I suppose you could obtain all of these articles separately but this book provides a nice introduction to several of man's most fundamental question via the thoughts of many different thinkers pulled into one place.
__label__2 Danger and difficult decisions evolve: In the near future three siblings are caught on different levels, between warring parents and a collapsing society. When their father devises a vacation for them, they don't suspect they're really being kidnapped and that an off-planet goal is the ultimate destination - when they do find out, danger and difficult decisions evolve in this fast-paced science fiction story which is especially strong on building the characters of three very different brothers.
__label__2 Long Live Layne!: Mad Season is one of the Seattle super groups to come out of the nineties. What I find so compelling about this record are two things. Mike Mcready's bluesy at times manical guitar work and the sincerity in the late Layne Staley's voice. Layne's vocals on this record have very little processing on them and you get to hear how truly great his voice is. There's a truth to these songs and a passion on this record that both Alice in Chains and Pearl Jam don't always have. Check out the track "Lifeless Dead" and "Above" both feature Layne displaying a wail that will send chills down your spine. With guest appearances by Mark Lanegan and a sound that is reminiscent to that of early seventies hard blues rock this album delivers. If you love rock in its purest form GET IT!! Not to mention Layne Stayley was one of rock n rolls most talented singers!
__label__1 Save your money on this one: I just read through this entire book and as a SAP consultant I don't think this book is useful for either the process or the technical sides of the house. The only useful thing about this book is a short listing of the most common tcodes and menu paths that are used for FI and CO. If you are new to SAP or wanting to understand the modules from an executive perspective skip this book entirely.
__label__1 Jutting wedge: Why did I go on an Alan Parsons spree? Aside from the cohesively agreeable I Robot and occasional inspired tracks, these time-stamped packaged deals can play like unworthy emulations of brighter influences.
__label__2 Interesting characterization: This movie was a great depiction of the inner conflict that women were experiencing in the 1950's. It follows a group of privileged young women during a year on their path to becoming educated wives. However, their journey is interrupted with the arrival of a new art professor; a West Coast free thinker who challenges their beliefs. The characters each epitomize the complexity of the feminine soul and how we often are our own worst enemies. Showing the funny side of conflict, and how one person who cares just enough can change the path of a person - or cement it; this movie is a wonderful, enjoyable journey. Definitely recommend for a mother daughter night or that girls night in, although the hubs enjoyed it as well!
__label__1 Movie covers get worse and worse: I adore the books and the movies, but every time the publisher releases a new set of paperbacks with movie cover art, their choice of covers get worse and worse. The current cover art for Fellowship of the Rings is particularly bad, since it features Frodo in Shelob's lair. They should have kept the cover art from the first release, when the first movie came out.
__label__2 Great Book: The Devil's Dictionary was just as funny as I imagined, and reading out loud the comical definitions of words to my friends earned many chuckles and quite a few times a mysterious disappearance of the book. Funniest book I have recently bought.
__label__2 Great DVD: Definitely worth the 23 dollars in my opinion. This dvd has some good fights with some exciting endings.
__label__1 Garmin Beanbag: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005UK9X/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_titleThe vendor was ok, just was missing the clip that I needed to install it onto the beanbag. I made the mistake just ordering one piece "assuming" it came together.
__label__2 This is the album that put Suave house on the map...: Excellent album...all star line-up with future big ballers Eightball & MJG, Tela, Mr. Mike, Thorough. ..this is a classic album for all rap afficianados ...this is how southern cuisine is supposed to be cooked: hot and finger-lickin' good...when is the next compilation comin' out cuz' I'm starving for more...C2
__label__1 This book should be R-rated.: If you want to read a smut-filled novel this would be a great choice. There is way too much detail involved in sexual events that happen in this book. There was a vividly-horrid violent scene written about in this book also. This was a choice for our book club one month, and only 2 people (of 7) were able to continue reading all the garbage that was in the book. The others refused to read such filth. For those who like to keep their mind out of the gutter, this book is not a good choice.
__label__2 Like Tony the Tiger said: "It's Grrrreat!!!!": I have been a fan for years and I must say that this is his best album yet. It's not very often you see an artist that can mix styles,moods and flavor and they all mesh well. Good job!
__label__1 Review of 3-D Only!: The 3-D for this DVD is outright terrible, they didn't even take the time to correct it. I'm sure it would look outstanding with BluRay 3-D or polarized, but anaglyph didn't do it justice and gave it a terrible name. Yet another horrible release from Paramount Home Videos... Terrible, terrible, terrible 3-D!!! STAY AWAY.
__label__2 INSIDER'S VIEW OF HOLLYWOOD LEGEND?: This is the book someone within the movie industry wrote or to which they contributed their undiluted insights. Unlike so many James Dean biographies, this one--despite its snide tone--shows a distinct recollection of events in the world of movies decades ago. Dean had more than a few associates and friends who might offer their opinions at this point. This book gives the 50th anniversary look at James Dean and seems to be told from the perspective of one of the many actors who burned themselves out trying to imitate their idol, or someone who was set up by the studios to be the next Dean clone. If you want to know something about the unvarnished James Dean, this book is for you. If you are looking for a sweet and romanticized portrait of a cad, this book isn't for you. It is a page-turner that will have you laughing out loud with recognition of those weak attempts of star-struck actors trying to be the next James Dean.
__label__2 Nice bike lift: Item works well, two issues-rope comes of hanger pulleys and tie knot at end of rope after you string thru pulleys so that it doesn't pull out by accident. Have four hangers installed in my garage.
__label__1 MIRACLE STINKS: what a poorly acted and unentertaining movie. Taking a few days to write an overly long kiss (...) review will not make it any better. Honestly, anyone on the left should know the game was thrown for the sanctity of poor relations between us and the dominent soviets. lucky for us, we soon had Reagan and all of the sugar coated media goodies like this fake match went away. For a better movie rent Schindler's list because the only true underdogs were the jews that made it out alive.focus people
__label__1 STOP - Don't waste your money: Bought this to use in our temporary outdoor kitchen whilst we remodeled.After 2 months one of the control knobs fell off the left plate. We didn't abuse it in any way.1 month later the same plate decided it only had one heat setting - HOT - and would not turn itself off. We had to keep unplugging at the mains.And now that very same hot plate is now a permanently COLD PLATE. Won't heat up at all.The right hot plate is more of a warm plate. Not enough power to bring anything to the boil. Had to boil water in the kettle and bring it over!Utterly ridiculous and hideous piece of cr@p.DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY.
__label__2 Rock with Resonance: You're going to be blown away. "Civilian" is a great mix of uptempo songs and ballads, some nice bluesy tunes like "The Ringing in My Ears" and really strong, interesting lyrics. The poetic phrasing in "Something of Ours" is particularly haunting.Pascal's influences are pretty clear here in the melodies-- rock pioneers of the late sixties and early seventies will hear their impact on this disc. However, the lyrics are unique and original.Oh, and by the way, if you weren't aware of it already, this guy has a voice that can reach down into your soul and rip your guts. Absolutely fantastic vocals.Well worth the money-- I've become hooked on this CD!
__label__2 Classic music for the 90's: Now here's a band that will save the deteriorating landscape of rock if they get the chance. Home Sweet Home delivers a sweet little collection of pop/grunge tunes (think of Weezer but different) so catchy and perfectly constructed I was amazed these songs were never written before (Well, okay, "Up and Down" seemed like filler, but even that was better than most). Recommended+++
__label__1 It took two seconds of reading: to realize this book was filled with absolute lies. I'm not sure certain people who call themselves "Christian" understand that it is not possible to love and exclude someone at the same time....and lie about it on top of everything else.
__label__2 Paradigm Shifting: New Testament scholars are all too ready to admit that John's Gospel shows a preexistent Christology (some even admit it of Paul's letters) but not too many are willing to admit the same of the Synoptic Gospels. If someone does see preexistence in the Synoptics then they're generally accused of reading later Christian theology into the texts or of reading them through Johannine lenses. Drawing from ancient Jewish literature as well as the New Testament, Simon Gathercole mounts a persuasive exegetical argument for preexistence in the Synoptic Gospels based on Jesus' "I have come" statements. This important volume has significant implications for modern discussions on ancient Christology.
__label__1 Great review information: This book contains great information on reviewing in Science, Math, and Verbal Ability
__label__2 Avril Lavigne brings a much needed spark to music industry: Before Avril's "Let Go," I couldn't find a CD where I could listen to every track 80 times and never get tired of them. But I can honestly say I love every one of her songs and can't wait to hear more from her. From the angry "Losing Grip" to the soulful "Naked," I can't find very many things wrong with this album. I've listened to "Let Go" so many times I can recite each song by heart (which may sound a little pathetic). From wannabe rappers to Mozart fans, this CD is sure to please.
__label__1 Yes to Kim & Aggie: I have mixed feelings about this book. I bought this book after watching their BBC show "How Clean is Your House." I will be honest and say that the notes I took while watching the show were more helpful than this book. In other words, I learned more by watching than by reading this book.The newest season is not as good as previous seasons as it seems they are using more --- modern --- cleaning "tools." Its very discouraging as they have some great home-made concoctions that are made from some very basic ingredients (laundry detergent, vinegar, lemons, tea tree oil, etc.)If you are a fan of the show I would say you could hold off buying this book. If you have never heard of Kim and Aggie before I say this book might give you some new inspiration - to clean. :D
__label__1 Days Gone By: Unless you're a new viewer of Days you won't enjoy the music. I was disappointed. Theme music from late 1997 and 1998. Enjoyed the opening and closing themes. I enjoy the love themes from 80's better. The picture of the cast on back is nice.
__label__2 Night Fire: I am a huge Shannon Tweed fan. The order arrived in excellent shape for a used dvd and arrived quickly.
__label__2 something new....: i listen to some metal, kittie great band. im new to otep and overall they're different. i like them.
__label__1 Complete waste by a has-been b-movie "actor": Do you want to take advice from a washed up b-movie actor? If so, buy this book.
__label__2 yummy!: all i can say is that this is a very cool cd. but, most people won't understand it because it's ahead of it's time. it's very hip!
__label__2 Excellent way to build your Japanese vocabulary: Contrary to what the prior poster stated, this is a supplement only, never intended for study in isolation. It's a great way to supplement your Japanese language study because most study programs are lacking in the vocabulary area and without a large vocabulary, you will not be able to hold any meaningful conversations. I have had no trouble using almost all the words I've learned through this program in everyday conversation. If you are simultaneously learning japanese grammer, you should have no problems using a verb, adjective, adverb, etc. learned through this program.
__label__2 Short BUT SWEET: Ahhh another great title in the lok series!! GREAT story graphics and ok game play. It took me one night to complete this game although the same can be said for bo2 (and sr1 the second time around) However the lok games are about storyline rather than gameplay. Id recommend it to anyone who likes a game that makes you think
__label__2 A Firm Start to the Road of Successful Leadership: I really enjoyed this book. It explored the ideals of leadership in a way that is very easy to understand and somewhat unique. It allows for easy implementation into a business setting. I believe that managers and people in leadership positions should explore the concepts in this book and give thought to whether or not they should be using them themselves. However, I believe this book is over simplified and in some ways comes across a tad bit arrogant. While, I believe this book provides an excellent element to effective and efficient leadership, it is most certainly not the only element. I feel that true leadership contains a conglomeration of many different ideas and components. With that said, this book coupled with other leadership books will allow for a truly great leader to grow!
__label__2 Very pleased and use it often: Before I bought this quesadilla maker, I used Salton's larger Santa Fe model. But I didn't like how little filling the Santa Fe allowed. Even though it cooks (requires) bigger tortillas than the Oster, the Santa Fe's edge-sealing feature (meaningless to me) takes up far too much tortilla space. I can fill tortillas on the Oster to within a half inch or so of the outer edges.Another plus for me: The Oster lets me use small corn tortillas, which I prefer over flour tortillas. The Oster takes much less storage space (I store it upright in the corner of a cabinet), has cord storage underneath, and the price is right. Clean-up has been easy: I dab on a tiny bit of canola oil after preheating, then add quesadillas. Cook for 3 minutes or so (both sides cook at once). Then wipe out cooker with damp paper towel.
__label__1 Oh please start over: Manly, good virile propaganda for Christians at last! It would have been a perfect addition to my coffee table library--next to Guns & Ammo and other heterosexual magazines. That is why it pains me to point out a fatal error. The front cover features a guy from my own militia. He's a good Christian. Not an Islamicist.
__label__1 P&:: I ordered Pride&Prejudice; DVD. The faces were white and the colors looked faded. I returned and requested a replacement. Unfortunately the replacement was the same and I returned.I took out a copy from the library and the same condition exists. I have concluded that the company that converted Pride&Prejudice; from VHS did not have the expertise to accomplish a TRUE copy.I have always had excellent service and do not fault for this purchase. Obviously it is the fault of the distributor.
__label__2 Love it but it had to grow on me.: It does have a strong soapy note, with a light powdery scent. You will smell very clean and fresh.This could easily be a unisex fragrance but it's nothing that would make a man feel awkward wearing it.
__label__2 Gunsmoke-50th: I really like this DVD set purchased from Amazon. It was delivered in a hurry and the picture quality is very good. The set also has some very good extras including an interview with "Miss Kitty".
__label__2 GREAT CAMERA: Knowing absolutely nothing about digital cameras I read all the reviews I could and trusted the Kodak name and took the leap of faith. I am so happy I did. This camera is so easy to use and the software is fabulous. I have taken quite a few 8 X 10 pictures and framed them and everyone cannot believe they were taken with this camera. I have to agree on a couple of points however, the door to the batteries and access door to the ISB connection is somewhat flimsy so be careful when you use it but other than that I have no problems at all. I highly recommend this camera to the "non-professional" like myself if you want an easy to use digital camera that takes great pictures.
__label__1 Waste of time, money and effort: Such a bad movie! This movie is proof that two A-List stars don't always make a great movie together.This movie is bad. It's painful to watch. I guarantee your apathy towards the movie will increase as the movie drags forward.And Julia Roberts!?!?!? What happened with her!?!?!? It looks as if the makeup crew went out of their way to make her very unattractive. She looked more like a stereotypical menopausal aunt than Julia Roberts. I commend her desire to have no plastic surgery, but yikes! I kept wondering what happened to her "girl next door" good looks she had in "Notting Hill." Those days are gone. Time can be a cruel, inescapable enemy.I am posting this review as a warning to all consumers: times are tough for most people these days, please spend your money on anything except this movie.
__label__1 Beautiful video but unexpected material: The video was beautiful but had unexpected coverage of Hispanic mysticism... day of the dead and worshiping dead relatives... not what I expected in a butterfly movie... I bought the movie for my 5 year old daughter who likes butterflies but I had to turn it off...
__label__1 Waste of money: This was a great gold box deal but not even worth the $14. The movies seem outdated and forget perfecting the moves, it'll take you weeks just to learn the routine with how fast paced they are. Definately not for beginners like the description said. Ended up being a waste of money as I went back to my Jillian Michaels dvd which I prefer because she explains every move and works in steps.
__label__1 If only it were satire: Ms. Klausner's review gave me pause. As satire, this book would have been interesting and would have merited her glowing review. Unfortunately, I think the author was utterly serious with this book. The turgid focus is mindnumbing, without ever being attractive or interesting. The perpetrators of the central mystery are obvious. And yet...Mr. Ryan can write. He held my interest all the while I said "this is appalling, what a narrowminded, pig". I would buy a paperback of the sequel in December to see how the lead character changes, now that she is leaving being a tigress behind.
__label__1 Piece of s***: Well I thought that part 3 was the worst in the series but then came along "the Next Generation" and it proved me wrong. Here are reasons why I think the latest "Chainsaw" movie sucks.1. Wasn't even a sequel really, just a horrible very unscary remake of the original. 2. The family was so boring, they ate pizza?!?!?! Aren't they cannibals? 3. Leatherface. If you've seen the movie then you'll know what I mean. His mask didn't look like human skin just a piece of latex, he wore an army jacket at one point and later in the movie a dress(!), he screamed like a little kid nonstop, he had long hair which looked awkward, this is just a few of the many many things I hated about this so called Leatherface. 4. The annoying actors and actresses. 5. No gore whatsoever not even a drop of blood.So those are the 5 main reasons. Don't even bother with this one. Pretend it doesn't even exist. Watch part 2 the ultimate sequel.
__label__2 Take your love life seriously.: I bought this book in 1990 and it changed my life.It proves that we should make as much effort into finding someone to love as we do when buying our favourite car or choosing a career."Better than nothing" relationships are not a consideration for me,quality is.I thoroughly recommend this book to every man and woman who wants to take their love life serious and look for quality in their love life.You study to further your career,why not your love life too.This book is the key to your future.You can find more books under "dating", "dating for women" and "dating for men" on this website.
__label__1 not "medium" for kids beyond preschool: This dog is cute and soft, but not "medium". My son saw a picture online, and I tried to describe the dimensions. When it arrived, it was smaller than I had expected. Hopefully on Christmas morning, he won't be as shocked as I was.
__label__2 Perfect Craziness: This movie was crazy. Crazy in a very good way. The first Crank was fast-paced, exciting, violent, and very well made for what it was. This sequel goes off the charts in every one of those categories mentioned in the previous sentence. If I didn't know better, I would say the makers of the film were on crack, or crank if you will, during the entire filmmaking process. This makes for an extremely hyper, flashy, hilarious, highly entertaining sequel that is sure to offend many but also make them cheer at the same time. It just looks like they are having fun making a crazy movie and it shows. Ripping good time of a flick! Plus it is inspiring to amateur filmmakers due to the fact that they are using such cheap cameras to make it.
__label__1 very dissapointed. expensive hype.: I'd been using the Sweet Almond Mint Wen for about a month prior to this purchase. Wanted to get the Tea Tree formula to help with winter hair...dry, flaky scalp. The scent of this is so/so, but more importantly...it simply does not work. Not only did it not help with scalp issues, I had to wash my hair every single day or it would become very oily. Sebastian Tea tree shampoo/conditioner is much more effective for scalp issues. Don't waste your hard earned money on this...not worth it.
__label__2 Absolutely Fabulous!: I'm only half-way through this book, and it is just completely terrific! It captivates the soul and excites the mind to horrific levels. This collection is the perfect thing for all of your moods! (Now I sound like a solicitor, don't I?) I usually like to read it in the bath tub, but it's the perfect thing for any time you need a quick reading-fix.
__label__1 does not do what it states: I been using this product for 1 week, it made me more consipated. really a waste of money. please don;t purchase this item, i don;t want to see someone else waste their hard earn money
__label__1 An edition of dubious quality: This review concerns the Cambridge Texts in the History of Political Thought Revised Student Edition (2007), edited by Ansell-Pearson and translated by Diethe. I have not systematically compared the English with the German but several things make me uneasy.The quotations from Greek and Latin are a chaos of misprints (see, for example, pages 14, 21, 68). Clearly no one familiar with these languages looked over this "revised" edition. Nietzsche the philologist would have wept.I also was confused by the German words occasionally included in brackets in the English text, as these often seemed to be neither key philosophical terms nor at all difficult to translate. For instance, why do we need to know that "such paradoxical and paralogical concepts" translates "solcher paradoxer und paralogischer Begriffe" (p. 94, cf. pp. 90 and 99)?
__label__2 My Favorite: This has been my favorite tea for more than a decade but I can't find it locally. I had been ordering directly from Twining but placed this order with Amazon because of the free shipping for orders over $25.00 which saves me at least $1.00 per tin. Saving a buck is always exciting to one of Scots descent and since I drink a pot every day, it can add up over time.
__label__2 Pretty good: This is a very good flight sim. CFS 1 was better in the graphics area. This has a way better story line though. This had wonderful graphics too but not as great as the first combat flight simulator.Some of the complaints I have about this game are1. Your wingmen are useless when you want them to do something2. Even though the game is pretty long I wish it stopped at the surrender of Japan or the Americans victory3. It is too easy to complete missions.Other than that this is a flawless game.
__label__1 She's a lip-syncing stripper: This latest offering from Britney Vanilli (has anyone ever heard her actually sing live and not just lip-sync?) is just track after track of trash. She is clearly devoid of all morals and no longer appears interested in even pretending that she had any shread of dignity left.
__label__2 ryka n-gage instructor: my recommendation is to order these shoes one full size bigger. thought there could be a little more cushioning in the front of the shoe under the ball of the foot but i added a pair of inserts to mine that i had hanging around from lady footlocker and they are great with the inserts. like the fact that they are a higher top. i use them for step aerobics. decided to try these shoes because i'm sick and tired of nikes that are expensive and just fall apart in 30 days. these shoes are fairly priced and a good value for your buck.
__label__1 Gandy: The Trudeaux peeler is satisfactory for peeling. The handle is a bit large for my hand and there is no pointy end for digging out the potatoe eyes.
__label__2 Orchestral maneuvers in funk: While big American bands team with orchestras, it's usually to record a self-serving, over-the-top concert album. However, Jimi Tenor, who has been described as "the Barry White of Finland," had something more ambitious in mind. Instead of conducting the 55-piece orchestra at his disposal through grandiose versions of his tunes, Tenor composed entirely new material. The slinky "Hypnotic Drugstore" offers a glimpse at trademark Tenor funk, but the rest of the album sees him using his resources to explore adventurous, and often bizarre, territory.
__label__1 Come On!: American Beauty is rediculous and just another bad flop made in today's days I really cannot stand this film. And this is supposed to sort of portray an american family that is just a bunch of bull. Please somebody write up a good film sooner or later!
__label__2 Very good concept, poor build quality, excellent customer service: Arrived in very good time, works very well but feels really, really light (not in a good way)...
__label__1 Gift from our daughter: My wife and I gecieved the toshiba SD-1700 as a gift from our daughter. She was so excited, 19 yrs old wanted to buy something really special for us. It was something that we used very little, maybe 25 movies, and now all we get is disk errors. Have bought disc cleaners thinking it was dirty for some reason. Nothing works, have the same problems that I have read in other reviews. Toshiba should step up to the plate and either repair or refund. Upset that we have to throw this special gift out.
__label__2 Homeschool Family Treasure: This is a great book about playing outside, opening your children's horizons, treating them with respect, and serving them. I have not read Charlotte Mason's original works, but this book is full of inspiring wisdom and guidance. I'm glad I read this book for my own child's sake.
__label__2 Love, Love, Love This Book: My brother lived in Italy for several years so I went to him to get a good recipe for Osso Bucco and he told me about Marcella. She is truly the Julia Child of Italy. Love, the book, the recipes and how they are displayed. Highly recommend.
__label__2 Great Gift!: Fantastic gift for a girl ages 5-10! My friend's daughter has used it repeatedly for the last year when writing thank you notes or creating her own cards.
__label__1 Very disappointing: Just the facts: A) the handset has a very uncomfortable feel to it, making a long chat very irrating B) I returned my first under warranty because there would be breaks where I heard nothing, the replacement ended up doing the same thing, sounds like you are using a cell phone, the co. blamed it on interferrance but none of my other cordless models do this and they are much older C) The digital answering machine message sounds awful. The message is often garbled and unclear making it sound like a worn out tape model. D) I'm replacing it!
__label__1 Good Heater Bad Smell: Lasko ceramic heaters work well and provide sufficient heat. The only problem I have with them is the smell. Upon turning the unit on the smell was so bad I had to remove it outside. It smelled up the whole house. This smellwill eventually go away when the ceramic heat tubes finally burn off all the oils and the new wares off. Runningit outside for 24 hours really did not help as far as heating the house. Probably would not buy another.
__label__1 THE EDGE *not* anamorphic: Despite what the specs on the back of the case say, THE EDGE is the same disc as the previous single disc release, i.e., 2:35:1 non-anamorphic. This is misleading and extremely disappointing. I picked this up at Circuit City thinking 20th Century had finally gotten their act together and given this outstanding film the presentation it deserved. I was wrong, now I'm stuck with a DVD I don't want that the store won't refund because it's open. Thanks, Fox Video, for overpaying some nitwit graphic artist who doesn't know what an anamorphic DVD is, and cheating me out of $10.00.
__label__2 Sleeping Ugly: Sleeping Uglyby Jane Yolenreviewed by Meghan - Stockbridge Central School 3rd GradeAre you tired of the same old fairy tales told over and over again? Here is one with a new twist... Sleeping ugly is about a really pretty princess on the outside but on the inside she is the meanest wickedest princes. Plain Jane is Ugly on the outside and really nice on the inside. I like this book because it has adventure and excitement. It is funny because Plain Jane is ugly and nice and Princes Miserella is pretty and mean. I recommend this book to first to third grade.
__label__1 I just did not like this book: I was looking forward to a real spy thriller here but all I got was a couple paragraphs of the spy plot in between pages of Anastasia and Lucas both having daydreams of of each other, or Anastasia bemoaning that she wasn't good enough to do the Job or Anastasia bemoaning the fact that she was being unfaithful to her dead husband(and even with all that you know who the spy is right off.) Lady Anastasia was without any backbone or self confidence, she was just too wishy, washy and weak for me. I like stronger heroines. And I hated the constant comparison between Lucas and her dead husband, it got old. I made it three quarters of the way through the book and I just couldn't take any more and I never had any desire to finish it. The book went in the box to donate to my local library. It might be more someone else's cup of tea.
__label__2 Very Entertaining show: I really like Pawn Stars Las Vegas, the guys are characters,but i like them. Some very interesting items show up on these shows
__label__1 All That U2 Can't Leave Behind: This is just a mindless album. It is a desperate attempt to try to parody earlier recordings. However, after two tracks it starts to blend into one of the worst U2 songs ever - Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own - that just does not seem to be going anywhere. Periodically there are shameless attempts at pop commercial singles. I have never been more let down from a band then I was by the so-called "U2" on this one.How could one explain how shallow and meaningless their music became after All That You Can't Leave Behind ? They gave up on art and opted for being ROCK ICONS, a damnable pity if there ever was one.If I were 80s Bono I would be embarrassed to even be associated with the ( now commercialized ) name U2, who unfairly subjected us to this torture they call a "U2" record....takes a second to say goodbye say goodbye oh oh oh
__label__1 disappointing . . .: i'm a big fan of cornwell's, but this book didn't do it for me. i didn't buy the fact that carrie is so brilliant that every single thing she does is on purpose so that scarpetta finds out about it. lucy needs a kick in the head.
__label__2 great cable v good quality: great cable v good quality, best cable for the price . i was worried about the thickness and quality of the cable , but i am v happy to see and use it .
__label__1 Supermodel with osteoporosis: It looks good, thats just about it!The watch itself feels like kid toys made in china that is going to fall apart anytime soon.The band feels like a cheap hollow tin can.When I read some positive amazon reviewers, they all says how heavy it is. but its way lighter compare to my cheap casio watch.It looks good because its rolex wanna-be, and thats about what you get for $90......Rolex looks.This will likely be my last invicta (who?) purchase.....Thanks Amazon for your fast shipping.
__label__2 Good quick read - maybe too little for the price: I saw this book a few weeks ago while in a bookstore and bought it on impulse. I knew it was just the original Ender's Game short story with a couple of new stories put out for a quick buck - but I didn't care.I cannot say that would reccomend that Ender fans rush out and BUY it - I do think that fans should read it. If you can inter-library loan it or borrow it from a friend - that is the way to go.
__label__1 Barley Pushing The Boundaries: These guys lately have had many articles about how they are supposed to be pushing the boundaries of extreme music, but in the end to me it didn't seem like anything that hasn't been tried in the past five years or so. Especially the parts of mixing the hardcore and jazz elements, I've heard many bands do better. Perhaps if they learned their instruments a little better it would all come across better. Some parts even reminded me of really bad nu-metal bands, but these guys were still a step above those bands. Another reason I didn't get into it much was all the rapping, I'm mainly into hardcore and the extreme side of metal, and feel rap has no place in either style.
__label__1 Palms outstreched for money: Looks like the truth comes out in season 5. Jason and Grant or portraying themselves as playboy millionaires that have money to throw around. They have defiantly strayed away from the original plumbers from the east that seemed honestly involved in their work
__label__1 A disappointing "blessing": After all the rave reviews, I decided I should give this film a try. Having now seen it, I guess I missed the "blessing" to which the film's title refers. Yes, the photography is gorgeous, and many of the scenes are esoteric and intriguing. However, the film's pace is glacial, some of the scenes go on way too long (especially the speeded-up urban traffic sequences), many of the scenes make little or no sense without at least some explanation, and I was unable to discern any sense of logic or connection in the sequencing of many of the scenes. When it ended, I was left feeling "Is that all there is?" An interesting experiment, but for me, one that doesn't deliver a satisfactory result.
__label__1 New Age Translation: Disappointing Taoist Buddhist Interpolation.This is Stephen Mitchell's Psalms inspired by David.that is ok, but lets be clear about it.Mitchell's trans of Rilke are superb, a god-send.
__label__2 As good as the first!: Book two of the Passport to Peril series was just as good as the first, with slightly more romance involved. Throw in another quirky sidekick (a girl has to have backup!) and you have a wonderfully funny, action-packed book that will keep you reading - and guessing. Once again, at the end of this book, I was compelled to run out and get the next book in the series.
__label__1 not complete: The movie I was sent does not have the last chapter. It stops and goes directly to the menu. If chosen from the scene selection menu, It will skip and jump back to the main menu.
__label__1 Voit CB5 Flat: I purchased 4 of the Voit CB5 balls for our church basketball league. The size of the ball is perfect for ages 4 - 6. 2 of the 4 ball will not hold air. I pump the balls up before each practice and game. The church purchased 4 balls 3 years back and they have been good balls. Very disappointed in the 2 balls that do not hold air.
__label__1 Outdated: Irlen's original hypothesis was interesting. It has been proven to be outdated, and this book (and the whole Irlen approach) ought to disappear from the helping-the-dyslexic shelf.Dyslexia is not a visual problem, it is a neurological processing problem. Glasses or colored overlays won't raise a kid's reading level--getting the brain to recognize sounds and the relation to symbols is the answer. The International Dyslexia Association has reliable information.I am sure there are people who are bothered by lights and so on who feel better when they wear dark glasses or whatever. It is just not a cure for specific language disabilities.I see the Irlen Screeners as desperately needing more "sufferers" to justify the cost of their training. "But it worked for MEEee!" is not an acceptable answer to "where is the research?"
__label__1 OK: For the price your better of to get the MIP CVDS for $8 more. These are the same as the stock and bend easily if you land the wrong way which causes a vibratrion a eventialy will kill your car.
__label__2 Ladies of the Chorus Excellent!: It was sent promptly and in good condition, AND it was a joy to watch!
__label__2 dear john letters: great cd. you'll really like it. I do. listen to it over and over and over. still not sick of it. that's something. plus they are great live. definitely my favorite local band right now.
__label__2 Best Iron on earth: I ordered this iron after using my mother's. My sister also bought this iron after one use of it. It heats up quickly and irons out even the toughest wrinkles. The steam button is my favorite feature and it can blast through a stack of laundry on no time. The cord is also nice and long allowing for great freedom of movement. I have seen this iron for sale at stores for much, much more money, so I also feel like I got the best price. Seriously...if you are in the market for a new iron...look no further.
__label__1 not so marvelous things: i recently went to see the snow patrol and heard that a band called eisely was opening for them. i quickly skimmed amazon to check out reviews and maybe pick up an eisly cd. i now regret buying the cd. eisely is a very very untalented band. their music is uncreative, bland and almost unlistenable. the female singers in this band will make you regret every second that you spend listening to them drone on and on. i swear that they sing each chorus a million times.in the first song the lead singer wails to the point where i've never been able to listen to the entire song. this e.p is so bad that i heard it playing in the dentist office during a root canal and THIS EP was causing me more pain.i've heard that this is a christian band or something and i suppose in the VERY shallow talent pool of christian rock this might pass as something other than pure audio diarrhea but to someone who enjoys talented musicians with female singers i would suggest Bjork or Portishead.
__label__2 Sockets Great, Case Big Fail: The socket set seems great, a full range from 9mm to 24mm, and with the more secure 12-point grip.But the plastic yellow case it came in was impossible to open. Painful and difficult to open. So I just cut the case apart, and put the sockets in a $1 plastic box I bought at Staples.I despise solutions -- like this poorly designed case -- that don't work at all.But since the main thing I was buying was the sockets, and they're fine, that's why I knocked off only one star.
__label__1 Disappointing: Fine as an introduction to Duncan, but not for serious study. At best, this is a "Greatest Hits" record--though that said, it's a bit like buying Bob Dylan's Greatest Hits. It's good in that it touches every portion of his career, but since Duncan worked so fiercely in the poetics of the series and the idea of "the book of poetry," ultimately it leaves the reader wanting.
__label__2 The CD is slammin': I got the CD today and I haven't stopped listening to it. I dont even buy CD's. But after hearing "GET AT ME DOG," "STOP BEING GREEDY," and "RUFF RYDER'S ANTHEM," I had to get his album. He's the best and "if you don't know by now then you slipping." He got his own unique style. All the songs on the album is phat. All hot enough to become singles. Trust me, the CD is slammin. Beats, lyrics, and everything else. You don't even have to know the lyrics, because the beat alone will have you so hyped, you'll forget about lyrics. Three record stores I went to, it was sold out. It took me forever to get this. Now I aint letting it out of my sight. Dark Man aint rappin' about brand name clothes, rolex, and all that mess like all them other rappers. He's just straight lettin you know what street n?**$% feel, cuz ya n?**$% want the real. Keep it up DMX, I LOVE YOU, that's my men and them.
__label__2 The most thorough, thoughtful and valuable of the genre: Beth simultaneously addresses the nitty gritty details of life "off the hard" by providing a ready reference, and bolsters the spirit for heading offshore with a personal glimpse of her adventure and cruising life. This will become part of our onboard library.
__label__1 Misto Gourmet oilive oil sprayer: I bought this sprayer as a Christmas present and the person used it only 2 times and the white screw cap inside that holds the spray mechanism in place broke. It seems that this is a faulty part of the sprayer. I would like to know if I could get a replacement part for it. I was very disapointed in this product due to it breaking.
__label__2 The real thing: When we announced this book was being used as the reference for a Sunday School class; I couldn't keep them in stock. Over 10% of our congregation now owns this reference. Even most couples, bit the bullet and bought two copies. Wow! What an indorsement!
__label__2 When the Five-Star System is inadequate.: Man... I would so easily give this album 6 or 7 stars if I could. It's incredible. Just INCREDIBLE. It's at once calming and distrubing. You can listen to it on it's surface, not really absorbing the entire sound, and it's great. But, if you immerse yourself in this music, you're truly going to see why Aphex Twin is the genius he is. Buy this album. Buy 2 copies of it. (I did. :)
__label__2 the Wonder of Ragtime: I bought this movie and it is a wonderful movie for children and adults. It is so funny and the animals are so talented. The owner trainer Patty Fairchild did a wonderfully training her animals. It would be a shame to miss out on this movie.
__label__1 Don't buy the Dome enclosure: The dome is excessively large and cumbersome compared to the camera.The power cable and adapter that came with it largely make the 110V power useless. considering that the main reason to purchase the dome is to mount the camera outside it would have been more reasonable to have the adapter built into the actual dome itself and then wire it up with the correct power cable direct from the mains. Instead they opted for a standard household adapter with a plug.I'm very disappointed with the quality and design of this product, not up to the usual standard from Dlink.For the price I would be better buying a new camera designed specifically for outdoor use.Don't buy this product you will regret it.
__label__2 Really nice skirt: I was pleasantly surprised when I received this skirt. It was much better styled than the picture indicated. A really super skirt.
__label__1 A waste of time: This book was all over the place. I usually love SEP and actually read this book because I had just reread Ain't She Sweet for a book club and wanted more of SEP but wish I had known my time would have been better spent reading Ain't She Sweet for a third time. The whole 'sacred' thing was really annoying considering that for the first three chapters all Daisy could think about was jumping ship. What was with the mini-explosions and then nothing more said about it? And then he's descedent of royal family? NO. I didn't buy any of it , when SEP is good she's great but when she's bad she's complete crap-glad I only paid a dollar for the book because that's all it was worth.Do yourself a favor and skip this one.
__label__1 Yikes! 80's flashback: I would definitely NOT recomend this. Don't be fooled by the cover. The guy does an intro to each session for about 30 seconds. Then it takes you back to 1989, with big hair, bad music and really, really, bad outfits. The kind with the tights and thongs. And a lot of big hair, lots of hairspray. I had to return it. No way I could follow the exercises when I couldn't get past the the fact the woman's bangs were 8 inches tall.
__label__2 great fun, wonderfully rendered: Baghead is terrific - fun and funny and engaging on every page, with a surprise ending every kid will adore. I read it to a group of eleven-year-olds, and they loved it, too. What a delightful story - I'm glad I stumbled across this book!
__label__1 This movie is beyond awful: Horrible acting, terrible plot, and awful musical arrangements (despite the fact that 80's hair metal rules). And even the least sensitive will be put off by the misogyny.
__label__2 Engrossing Prison Drama!: This beautiful period prison drama features expert performances by a talented cast, mainly Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins. It is the story of hope and friendship in extreme circumstances, a movie about the undominable human spirit. Slow moving, which accentuates the passing of decades in the prison. Great direction by Frank Darabont and attention to detail. Extremely satisfying ending, both dramatically and story-wise. One of the best films of the decade. From a scale of 1-10 I give this movie a 9!
__label__2 Fine: This album is much more predictable, as we come to know what you're expecting from KISS, with all four original members doing vocals. A much more metal oriented album than any of its predessors. It is with this album KISS lost their ability to shock people, and it comes across as fine music. Because they could no longer shock people with their music, many bands resorted to freakish/ outlandish statements. Key tracks are: I Stole Your Love, Christine Sixteen, Shock Me, Love Gun and Hooligan. Contains lesser known filler as on Destroyer. With this album, Destroyer, Rock and Roll Over and Alive!, KISS was the first musical group to have four albums on the Bilboard 100 simultaneously.
__label__2 Fantastic!: Believe the good reviews for this item! This grinder is fast, easy to clean, and does a great job... and you can't beat the price. I don't live in a climate prone to static (Miami), so I can't comment on that reported issue- but I can definately attest that this grinder lives up to my expectations- is sturdy, and is easy to use. It's just for my wife and me, so it's small size is perfect for grinding up enough to brew for two (espresso grind). A short wooden skewer makes cleaning the exit shoot easy- I suppose a children's toothbrush would also do well. The beans even feed well into the hopper to grind.
__label__1 I know I've already reviewed this book, but....: I just felt that an average of 3 stars is misleading and felt that it was my responsibility to prevent any other innocent readers from strangling themselves with this poor excuse for instructive literature...
__label__1 Norwegian Flag: How terrible to decorate the cover of a book called "Welcome to Denmark" with a Norwegian Flag!
__label__2 The Dark Tower #2: I'm giving the same review to all the comics in this series. It's too bad that King's epoch is so monumental that this comic serialization represents only a miniscule slice but for an abridgement it is excellent and,in my opinion, they've chosen the best segment. The writing is good, the art work alone is worth the purchase of the series. The insightful essays following each segment were enlightening. The down side was the back-slapping, self-gratification-fest that ended each book. If I felt any need to know how talented each of the contributers felt the others in the group were I'd go on the internet and look it up. I'm paying for a book, not an awards dinner. bg
__label__2 Great product!: My 3 year old son was forever complaining about soap or shampoo in his eyes. We tried lots of products, including J&J and California Baby. Finally we tried Magic Baby and he hasn't complained since.
__label__1 Worst transaction with Amazon Ever!: Usually my purchases with Amazon are flawless, so I am saddened to have to write a bad review.This Bike came to us with the box crushed and literally broken and punctured held together with tape, I looked inside but really could not tell if everything was in there so we accepted it from Fed-XWe were missing several parts that we were going to try and just get from Amazon to make it work out, with out sending it back; however when my husband went to put on the front tire we noticed the front forks were severly bent, he said it had to have been run over by a truck and would not be something repairable. In all fairness this is the ONLY time we have ever gotten a bad item from Amazon and they were very good to take it back without a hassle so we will continue to shop with them in the future.
__label__2 A NEW FAN: I was in Tower Records in SF last week and heard the first track, "Long Beach" over the PA system and bought the CD immediately. The best I can describe it is a giant wave of distorted tones that together make incredible melodies. Not for the fragile minded. Some very moody and beautiful stuff. Going from one song to the next is like chapters in a book. Each song has a different story to tell.
__label__1 Way overpriced, general UNIX book: I did not find in this book anything that may justify its price. It is a general book on UNIX that repeats the same things like any of FREE pdf books by GNU project or "UNIX for dummies" that is 6 times less. The book is also full of mistakes, and on some subjects it's plain wrong. To spend this kind of money you can find much better options out there.After reviewing most of the ecstatic reviews on this book I conclude they are fake.
__label__1 would not recommend: I bought this for my scottish terrier/yorkie mix who has a barking/whining problem over everything. It did absolutely nothing, at first he would just acknowledge the sound but did not stop him at all. After a day or so he completely ignored the sound totally. total waste of money.
__label__2 Hoot - the movie: It's a great movie. I would also suggest reading the book. My 8th graders had to read it for school. I would recommend to anyone of any age. It is a story about a boy who moves to Florida who meets some interesting people.
__label__1 Not worth the paper it was printed on: This "book" is full of the same old garbage that EVERY health organisation in the world has, in the past decade, proven wrong. Any book that would seriously quote a sit-com isnt worth a dime. I love Seinfeld and took the foreskin comments for what they were: jokes. This should be filed under fiction. If the foreskin was so hazardous to a mans health why has mankind thrived for the past 2 million years without circumcision? Because the foreskin is not deadly which is why I left my son intact. He has had no problems of any kind at all. Reading books like this only makes me feel better about leaving my son intact because this book marks a new low for the pro-circumcision camp and shows just how desperate they've become in the lack of medical evidence.Very sincerly from a circumcised dad who's just a bit envious of his intact son.
__label__2 FABULOUS book!!!: I bought my first copy of this book when my children were preteens. I also bought copies for all my friends for Christmas gifts that year. I read it in one sitting and LOVED it. It explains everything that happens as your child goes from childhood to 'tween and it does it in a hilarious way. It also explains why they do what they do and why it has to happen for them to move into adulthood.My children are now 33, 31, and 29 and I continue to buy copies for friends who have young children. I also have recommended it to all my middle school student's parents. This book is PRICELESS!
__label__2 Therefore, Stand by Wilbur M. Smith: This is an older book on Christian apologetics. Dr. Smith does an excellent job on defining apologetics and pursuing several of the main topics, including Creation, the Resurrection, the righteous judgment to come and peace and joy in believing. He puts forth telling arguments in defense of the faith and in opposition to modern day liberalism and antagonism toward God and God's people and God's work. Throughout the book he produces scholarly research documentation for his positions. I heartily recommend it to thinking Christians!
__label__1 Whoa don't buy this!: Now that I have your attention, I would like to explain why. Firstly I have owned the vinyl copy of this since it's release and the album is amazing and something everyone should own BUT these early Young releases are in need of remastering especialy if you own a decent sound system. Young has been sitting on his a** way too long to release remasters. Rumour has it he wants a certain sound and an artist has that right but in the meantime clean these up and release them for us living in a digital world. Perhaps if the catalogue slows down pressure will be brought to bear.
__label__2 Great Movie: Another great Taratino film. Perhaps not the best, but definitely worth watching. All of the performances are top-notch and the dialogue is in-depth, as you'd expect. If you haven't seen it, please do!
__label__1 This item is not available: I ordered this unit on February 7th. Every time I checked back on the status of the order, it read "not shipped" and the estimated shipping date got moved out. I really don't think this unit is avaialble from the company anytime soon. I cancelled the order.
__label__1 Trust the reviews: I just had to get this toy for my kids, even though the online reviews trashed it. I chose not to believe them, but they were right. These dolphins have all the musical value of an involuntary nose whistle. It is near impossible to get them all in a circle, and if you do, they just come apart. My kids now use the dolphins as pouring toys and the rings as bracelets. I just wish they would break so I could throw them away.
__label__1 A rather poor effort: An interesting plot and thought-provoking premise is subverted by very poor, cliche-ridden writing. Richard Dreyfuss should stick to acting, and Turtledove should stick to winning Hugos.
__label__2 Loud fast, heavy, yet unbelievably catchy...: I first heard of these guys in a short article of Guitar World and later found this CD at a music show for pretty cheap and decided to pick it up. While the songs are very heavy complete with loud vocals, humorous lyrics, heavy fast power chords, and screaming solos, what do you expect from a 90's punk band? NP proves to the world, that they play what they want to and not what the public wants to hear. Their live shows sound very interesting complete with a fire-breathing bassist and crazy stage antics. If you like it loud and fast, give this one a try! You gotta love the cover too, heh.
__label__1 lousy text: terrible textbookI took this course from the university that the author taught at. the book was this textbook. the pedagogy was terrible, some units such as (At/m) were not properly defined, the commentary was minimal except where it was copied from other books. it seems that the auther cannot be bothered to give a thorough explanation of the the basic concepts, and would only add in text as an afterthought. as a practicing professional in the field and as someone who has taught university level courses, I would say, find another textbook
__label__1 Incestual!: To quote one of the characters from the book as they described a key plot in this book; disgusting. I couldn't believe it, you kept reading and it kept getting worse and worse and worse! It was all so sorted and predictable. What a waste!!
__label__1 leave the book at home: If you take the words of a "travelor" who seems to get the info from a bar room chat in UB, without wanting to actually go anywhere, then this is your man. I have used many other Lonely Planet Guide Books with great success. Obviously this one got by the hands of the quality control forces. If anything good comes of it maybe it will just persuade people not to go there. The country is one of my favourites, so I like to think I'll selfishly enjoy it on my own.
__label__1 Works -- but really, really slow.: This product works -- but is ridiculously slow.On my 2.4Ghz P4 machine:- Screen refreshes take multiple seconds.- Portfolio view changes can take 10-15 seconds.Please, Microsoft, FIX the performance. Assign a realdev team to re-architect it. Please.
__label__2 Carol Burnett: We are enjoying them. Some are funnier than others - but we like to watch the shows. A lot different than shows today.
__label__2 Kongs Saved my LIfe!: My dogs are home alone while I'm at work. We fill Kongs with peanut butter and/or dog treats. It gives them hours of something to do while we're away. They can be washed over and over. Great quality. We even use them at the animal shelter b/c they can be bleached.
__label__2 Great Collar!: I have a mini schnauzer that loves to bark. When I take him on walks he will just bark for no reason. I didn't want to get a shock collar so I though I'd try this one and it works great. He was scared of it at first when it sprayed him, but his barking has gotten so much better. With it on, he will bark once or twice but that's it. A great product!
__label__1 Some good, some bad, too much Gin Blossoms: Songs like "Suitcase," "Lizardrin," and "She Came On" are shiny power pop nuggets. Most of the tracks here drag, though, and some of the better ones have a slick sheen that is far to reminiscent of the Gin Blossoms for my tastes.Super Deluxe's Via Satellite album is a little bit better than this one. Both albums can probably be found in a cut-out bin near you.
__label__2 PERFECT!: We use this to store Organic Whole Grains for use in our flour mill. It keeps the grains well, and keeps out unwanted moisture.
__label__2 Callas' famous Covent Garden debut: Norma had not been sung at Covent Garden since Rosa Ponselle's glorious performances until Callas arrived in 1952 and triumphed incredibly. Joan Sutherland, later to be a great Norma and the sweet Clothilde on this set, describes how she stayed close to the stage to listen to the "incredible beauty of Maria's and Ebe's singing". Sills said she took Callas' singing as a role-model for her own Norma, as did Caballe and Sutherland. (They all said it, it can be read and heard in many sources) Sills adored Callas so much that she said "I'd rather have five years of Maria instead of twenty of myself". Of course she would never have done that but it's a sweet, respectful gesture towards the older colleague and inspiration. This Norma will take your breath away. If Joan Sutherland was satisfied, then you will be too!
__label__1 Terrible Book.: I have never read anything that resembled utter junk than this. I must congratulate the author on his esoteric-convoluted writing style, because it has made understanding the concepts that much more difficult.This book has absolutely no merit what so ever. In fact, this book is so bad, I will burn my book rather then selling it to fool some other prospecting buyer into thinking this is a good book.YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!!!!!!
__label__1 tiffen filter: filter is ok..I get a lot of reflection on the pics taken with flash or if bright lights are in the background( Christmas lights etc)
__label__1 DRIVER:PL FOR Wii DOES NOT SUPPORT STEERING WHEEL: I own this game on PS2 and it is awesome. Not as great as the original Driver, but close. However, ON Wii, THIS GAME SUCKS because YOU CANNOT USE ANY Wii STEERING WHEEL with this game. NO STEERING WHEELS AT ALL!ON the Wii version, THE VERY STUPID MAKERS OF THIS Wii VERSION of DRIVER PL, must have been taking drugs when thinking it would be better to use the Nanchuck for driving. Very stupid! Wish I would have known the steering wheel was not able to use before buying this game. Anyways, I love all the Driver games on Playstation, and this Wii version was a total dissapointment. The makers of this game need to get some brains and TAKE THE ORIGINAL DRIVER GAME (from the old original PS1 system) AND PUT DRIVER 1 ON Will for use with the Wii steering wheel. Like I said, ALL the Driver games on PS & PS2 are great. Including Parallel Lines. However Wii OWNERS BEWARE! Get this version of Driver for PS2 and NOT Wii!
__label__1 Disappointed...: My problem is mainly with the packaging. When we opened the case, the dvd had popped out of its holder and was extremely scratched.
__label__2 An absolute must for serious Internet information.: A fabulous book. The clear, sharp style has dragged me through a lot of technical stuff that I would have otherwise been ignorant of. You have armed me to the teeth and in the coming weeks I will decapitate the consultants I hired for my web service project.Or perhaps I will force them to buy the book and read it on their dime, not mine.
__label__1 Do NOT buy this edition of Democracy and Education: This edition of the book is absolutely awful. The type is small and printed in a grayish fuzzy font that is hard to read. The margins are almost nonexistent. There is no space to write notes, not even at the bottom of the page. You will notice that this book is only 194 pages, whereas I recently found a very good used copy that is 378 pages. Both are unabridged, but in this edition the text is crammed onto the pages. Also, just scanning through the book today I quickly found two typos. Avoid this cheaply constructed edition. I sincerely hope Amazon stops selling it.
__label__1 F#&^%ing Fiction: Simple: The film-makers state at the beginning of the movie that it is true.They lied.Then they continue to lie. . .And lie. . .And lie. . .I don't care that it was suspenseful, that the acting was good, that the camera work was professional. I do care that I was being lied to.Not thieves. . .Liars.
__label__1 a flat movie: Am I supposed to feel sorry for this guy? I suppose the other main plot was who turned him in. The movie was just flat. No peak, no climax...jst flat.
__label__1 Dangerous: I bought this since my daughter and I go to the parks often. But was very unsatisfied with the product. We use it for a couple of minutes and had to put it away. My daughter is 16months old and every time she tried to stand up she would slip and fall on her bottom! The Fabric kept on moving under her and making it slippery for any one to try and sit down or walk accross it!Would not recommend it to anyone to purchase!
__label__2 Fred's radio: Works good I like the selectivity for days on and off the display> The only 2 things I wish it had are digital tuning and presets as well as better quality speakers
__label__1 Gaynor rehashes old alternative med news: Gaynor is now sounding just like Depak Chopra, Bernie Segal and Andrew Weil. There is not much new in this volume and it reads as if a ghost writer cranked it out according to a Gaynor "formula". If this is the first time you've ever heard the empowered patient/you deserve a better doctor argument then this is not a bad quick fix. Gaynor's earlier books have greater nutritional value and actual content. This is a beginner's feel-better guide to a better cancer patient experience. It reminds me of Andrew Weil's trick of repackaging the same stuff ten ways to create new selling "opportunities".
__label__2 don't crawl seek his burn of war: this is certainly of the best albums of the 90's. to listen to this album is to enter neurosis' twisted world of gloomy atmosphere, mental toxitation and apocalyptic tension. there's not that many albums with concept as deep and challenging as this. at its worst it's a crushing and effecting album of huge dynamics and at its best it's a religious experience, personal revolution or spiritual apocalypse.
__label__1 Not great: I loved the Hamilton Beach knife I had for 20 years. I don't love this one. I have small hands and this is not ergonomically suited for me. It is awkard to the point of being dangerous. The knife cut is ok, but not clean. It shreads alot.
__label__1 Not that great!: I was so disappointed when I opened the box to put the decals on this bus. Mattel has really come down with the quality of their products. I had a camper way back when and I can remember it being much better than this. The fridge and bathroom doors wouldn't open. If I managed to get the bathroom door open, it would come off. The bed keeps coming apart. Then, the worst - Christmas Eve and the darn thing didn't work! I re-checked batteries, etc. Nothing. Amazon was fabulous about replacing it - I had a new one on Dec. 27 and told my daughter that Santa sent it to us and he was sorry the first one didn't work. The second one works and the doors are much better, but the bed still falls apart the minute you touch it. Very frustrating for a three year old. I didn't want to get it based on other reviews, but it was one of only three things my daughter asked Santa for and I kind of felt like I had to. She does love to play with it, however.
__label__1 Very Disappointing: Wow, what can I say? This is a huge disappointment. I don't think you really need this book because Stridsman's first book is good enough and better. The problem with this book is that the systems are rehashes of articles that the author has already written for Active Trader magazine, and the systems are not even that good. This book is "been there, done that" -- it does not advance the technical analysis literature with any new concepts or ideas. I had a strange feeling of deja vu only a few pages into the book. Again, I am really surprised that this book was released - cannot recommend it at all.
__label__1 Hilarious movie: A couple of criminals who happen to be kids and insane survive a deadly crash. They come upon a lodge own a greedy old man and his guests.This as others have stated is a "so bad it's good" type of movie. The deaths are rather unique although unconvincing. It's hilarious how these kids can get away with what they do and there lies the appeal in it.I'll give it credit, it's a rather different plot and movie than those other horror flicks. It does have the usual formula of other flicks. Many of the characters are unlikable and you don't feel too bad when they meet their end. Leif Garrett is pretty funny as one of the evil brats.
__label__1 End this Journey quickly: Journey- Steve Perry= a joke. Somebody should sue for false advertising. I'm a huge Journey fan and would not go see this Journey cover band if they were playing in my basement. Shame on all of these greedy people who used to play in Journey.
__label__1 a load of bollocks: george michael was right. a lot of the new music coming out of britain today is rubbish, and the new radiohead record proves it won't get better anytime soon. this is a very hard record to listen to. only die hard radiohead fans will love it, and even they may become frustrated by the " experimentation" the boys have put into the record. i'm all for being ambitious, but don't be so ambitious to the point that people can't understand your music. it debuted at number 1 on the u.s. charts,and its already out of the top 10.buy it only if you really like radiohead, but don't say i didn't warn you....
__label__2 Is Fox slanted?: Its almost a funny thing to debate whether Fox is an actual news network. What is it that makes the devil so good at his job? He mixes truth with his lies. Of course Fox News isn't evil, but they are trying mighty hard.This film was a good documentary that succeeds in spite of itself. Luckily for the film makers the truth basically tells the story and the slow mish-mash of mediocre editing takes little from the intent.Good but not great. Preaching to the choir.
__label__1 You might get a few good years out of it.: I paid A LOT of money for this tv 4 years ago, so I expected it to last. Last it is not. The screen is slowing being covered in blue. The cause is unknown to us and to Sony and cannot be fixed, so the only suggestion Sony will give is to replace it. Which when we can no longer stand it we will do, but it will not be replaced with another Sony...ever again. Be aware that we are not the only ones with this problem in fact we've heard of much worse cases than ours with this tv. In fact Sony has actually had people purchase replacement bulbs and other stuff that does NOT fix the problem and sticks the customer with the cost of the replacement merchandise!My review on this tv...buy a different one and from another company with better customer service!
__label__2 great product: My royalty with this brand has lasted for more than 5 years since the 1st time I use it. It is amazing and also recommended to me by my friend. I will refer my other friends to it too with no doubt.
__label__2 Funny & Irreverent: Christopher Moore makes me laugh so hard. How can you not laugh at the thought of Jesus having a best friend named "Biff"? Of course, it is completely irreverent, so if you shock easily, maybe this isn't the book for you. Biff is quite the character, with his sinning (human) ways, which plays nicely next to Jesus' very austere self. I think everyone needs a friend that keeps you in check. It was interesting to hear those gaps of Christ's childhood filled in (if not accurately, then at least entertainingly).
__label__2 Great Service: I received my purchase within 7 days of ordering it and as described. I will be using this vendor again!!!!!
__label__1 Pretty much worthless: As others have stated, the ink cartridges are expensive and last an unacceptable amount of time. Printing in color produces poor quality images, and even if you only print black and white text the color cartridges drain. It is impossible to print black and white only if even one of the colors is out.
__label__1 They suck, and they hurt: I'm not an audiophile, and even I can tell this is bad. I played Radiohead with my ipod and it sounded like a tin can. Also, these things hurt your ears. I get a headache everytime I put them in. Without listening to music it hurts regardless. My ears are not mishaped in any way. This is just a poor product. For cheap earphones that have good quality, get the Coby's.
__label__2 Pay respect to DD: A big fan of reggae, I wasn't familiar with Dekker's work although I enjoyed his songs without knowing who sang them! This cd contains a number of classic tunes--Israelites, Shanty Town, I-tek, and Dekker's (excellent) cover of the Jimmy Cliff classic "You Can Get It..." Listeners whose point of entry into reggae is Bob Marley or Jimmy Cliff will enjoy this pioneer of the unique Jamaican sound.
__label__2 Energetic, with great chemistry between Gable and Gardner: Clark Gable liked to make westerns, according to imdb.com, and I think he excels at the genre. This movie has great energy, Gable and Gardner are great together, and it's got great dialogue. On a more personal note, I think it's truly outstanding when a movie gets me more sensitized to the horror of violence, and not since I saw The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance has a movie done that to me, as this one does at the end. It's interesting how Broderick Crawford, the villain, slowly grows on you as a desperate, ruthless fiend; you know he is early on, but as his determination to gain power plays out, he becomes more and more formidable. He makes a great villain.
__label__2 A personal perspective of the Hungarian Revolution.: Liptak is a Hungarian nationalist as well as a U.S. citizen. He describes how he became one of the univerisity rebels during the Hungarian Revolution and the personal consuquences of his decision. He lost his country, his love, and his family relationships as a result of his decision to take part in the Technical University's rebel groups.This revolt eventually encompassed the entire Hungarian nation as citizens rose up to oust the communist regime and replace it with true patriots. This was done to the Russian occupier's dismay. The fighting in the streets between the Hungarian secret service and the Russian occupiers caused much damage to the capital Budapest.This is a nice book about the Revolution. I see that Liptak is a Hungarian nationalist and still thinks that parts of Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, and Austria should again belong to a greater Hungarian nation. Despite this, this is a good account of the two week Hungarian Revolution.
__label__2 Quindlen does it again: Anna Quindlen shows us she is still an incredibly gifted writer with the uncanny ability to draw us into a story and become part of the character's lives. We love them, we hate them, we feel sad for them, and we cry for them.In her latest book, Blessings, Anna tells a tale that reads like a soft breeze on a balmy summer day. And just when you relax into the softness, Anna orchestrates a startling turn of events where all the characters remain true to their roles. A master of storytelling!Often I will not continue to read an author after they have published a few works. It seems like popular writers hop on the "write as fast as you can and forget about quality once you have a readership following" band wagon. I do not see that trend with Quindlen and will continue to seek out her works.This one's another winner.
__label__2 Wish Croc Still Made These: I love the grips on the sole. They are great for wet surfaces and are well cushioned. Strap can pull loose from the sole after they have been worn a long time.
__label__2 The heroic clients of the world: This was by far the best book I have read that could benefit beginning therapists in search of a therapy model. Clients needs always come first and this book just proves that over and over. We are the experts in the room on therapy but they are the experts of themselves. If you don't allow them to be the main focus of therapy you may as well not be in this profession.
__label__2 Awsome!: This is an awsome book to read becuase it keeps you on the edge the whole time. Its about a young highschool girl who gets angrier and angrier everyday. All the kids at her school would do mean things to her all the time. They just kept getting worse. Little did she know she had telekinesis powers that could change the whole towns outlook forever. I can see why she did what she did. All the anger building up inside of her she was about to explode. Although it starts off a little slow, this book is definetly one of the scariest and most thrilling books I have ever read. I had never read a Stephen King book before this one, but I had always heard wonderful things about them. I started out just reading it because I had to for a book report. By the time I got all the way through it I was ready for more.
__label__2 RIVER AND KEANU ARE GREAT TOGETHER!!: This is one of River's most emotional roles while he was alive, and he is great in the film! Keanu is also great in the film! River and Keanu have also worked together in other movies, such as "I Love you to Death" which you are able to buy at Amazon.com I have seen nearly all of River's film's and if you are a fan of his work then you need to see this film! WATCH IT!
__label__1 This is a book? Wake UP: This self important demented old man actually thinks people care about his opinion. He knows nothing about Israel or the struggle these people and knows nothing about pretty much any issue that he seems to want to meddle in. He feels this way just because he once had the title President of the United States, and for this he thinks he deserves a respectful ear, he is by far with very few exceptions, the worst, most stupid, most ineffective president the United States ever had, and he should really go quietly in the good night and leave his opinion out of an issue like the Israeli-Arab conflict, it is complicated and as very few reviewers seem to want to mention, brought on by wanton Arab oppression of their own people and the Arab leaderships desperate need to heat up the conflict to direct attention and energies away from their own crimes. Jimmy, shut up and dissapear already, your opinion is stupid, and your lifes work amounts to absolutely nothing.
__label__1 Should be renamed "two-day cooler": I purchased this cooler to augment my already well used Igloo five-day cooler (which I love.) We took them both camping and I was shocked to find that I had to keep restocking this cooler with ice every two days. The lid is designed to be pushed down, but has no tight lid-locking mechanism like the Igloo does, so I'm guessing that's the major difference. Although we took great pains to make sure that we tapped the lid down all the way around everytime we removed something from the cooler, it just did not work as advertised. I am very disappointed in this product. If it weren't for the fact that I would have to pay back the "prime" shipping if I returned it to Amazon, along with the return shipping and restocking fees, I would send it back immediately. I did email Coleman about this product, but have yet to receive any reply from them. My advice? Buy the Igloo and save money in the long run.
__label__2 Great family friendly movie!: I thought this movie had enough content to suit the whole family. I like the story and how humorous it was throughout. I enjoyed this movie very much and would recommend to anyone who likes these type of animated movies.
__label__2 Great product!: We looked at the diaper genie system but the refills for it were so expensive that we opted instead for a Diaper Champ and these bags. Love the bags versatility, threw a dispenser in the diaper bag for on the go and use them by the changing table in the diaper champ. When babies r us stopped carrying them I bought a zillion of them here on Amazon so we could make it through (hopefully) till we are potty trained. It's a great product that I could not make it through a day without!
__label__2 Coat of Arms: This book has great examples, easy to read and follow and will be perfect for kids 8-12 to use as well as adults. Its a good book for teachers and Medevil buffs.
__label__2 Gives a good, basic step workout: I haven't done step in about 7 years, so I bought this as a basic reintroduction. It gave me a good workout, but was really boring. The steps were basic enough, even in the advanced section, I had no trouble following it. But the music is terrible and I thought the pace was slow, I found myself going faster than Kathy. Also, this can't be a new dvd because their outifts are from the 80's, thong leotards and the men are in skin tight shorts and t-shirts. The outdatedness kind of bugged me, and the lack of music was a letdown. But I did sweat and I certainly got a decent workout, but I am going to look for something a little more current.
__label__1 I cant believe it was just the brass part: I recieved this on time and was eager to replace my chrome version of another make. All I recieved was the brass piece. This is not a fixture. I called the company and they were absolutly no help and said that there was nothing that they were willing to do to help. :(
__label__2 Professor as Madonna, or Madonna as Professor?: Professora Paglia is interesting! A lesbian who likes sex with men. A former (?) Catholic so steeped in the puritanism that she lambasts that she has trouble with sex. She predates the Sokal hoax in attacking the nonsense called poststructuralism and other hardly-baked "ideas" of postmodernism. She deserves credit for that. Without PC, in the form of the sexual harrassment laws, Mr. Starr would have remained only the boring, unknown, fundamentalist lawyer that he really is. One irritating point: her (philosophic) idea that every raped woman should enjoy the rape just a bit: that wild notion probably was not derived from experiment! But that's the trouble with most of philosophy. It's just that: mere philosophy.
__label__2 Big Hemingway fan: Very well written with lot's of first person experiences with Ernest to share - at times you almost feel like you are sitting at Ernest's favorite Havana bar with them. Hemingway was a very interesting character and this book does great job of aquatinting the reader with the eclectic and fascinating and unique American icon. Enjoyed the read vey much!
__label__2 Wowowow I miss these tales already!: I purchased this not too long ago and the intro is great, each tale hilarious, and OH!!!! Do I miss it! I can't find it amongst my stack of books and Walpole's stories are nothing short of hilarious! This book was written not for money, but spread amongst his friends, which gives it a warm tone. Each story has its own charm, but altogether I just remember laughing so hard, I don't think I'll ever have such a great book like this one again. He outshines Dr. Seuss just by sheer humour alone! If you haven't bought it yet, it's worth every penny! Simply fantastic! Please do not miss out!
__label__1 Topo 6.0: This map program will not work properly in Windows Vista with certain Intel chips. It has no 3d maps as advertised by DeLorme. Works fine with Windows XP. Vista users better wait for Topo 7, if and when it is released. Read about all these problems with Vista on DeLorme discussion board
__label__2 Responsibility Chart: I enjoy this magnet chart. It psychologically motivates my daughter to get up, brush her teeth, make her bed, etc. Once she has completed each one, she runs to the chart and makes her selection of which magnet she wants to use and, with excitement, places it under the category and correct day of the week. I would recommend this to anyone!!
__label__1 A relic even before it hit store shelves: This book should be where beyond.com is right now - in the trash. A perfect example of the smug "there at the right time" internet millionaire espousing common sense, and uncommon nonsense as business practice.The tone of the book clearly broadcasts the authors ego and self importance. The content, however, reveals the truth; the bubble was always just full of hot air.If are searching for a reference to help improve your management skills, look elsewhere.
__label__2 Works Great: After 2 months of daily usage, the kettle works great. It's simple to use and has a sturdy metal feel, given the low price. I know that I haven't used the kettle long enough to write a detailed review, but so far I haven't see any signs of rust, loose parts, leaks, power failures, shocks, etc. I looked at few expensive kettles ($60 to $100), and decided to go with this highly rated product. You can also find it at Target, if you want to see how it feels. I haven't noticed any issues with the handle getting hot( as some people have mentioned ). However, the metal will get very hot ( but that's expected with all kettles )Suggestions- Maybe the outside of the kettle can have a heat strip that will turn red when the kettle has hot water.
__label__2 An informative,sensitive book. The only one of it's kind.: The information given was clear and complete. The stories of other people's losses were moving. Most books focus on preventing miscarriage. This book helps you to heal by explaining the truths of miscarriage.
__label__1 Poor design!: I ordered this tripod only to have it arrive with two of the lower leg struts (plastic) broken so the legs couldn't be braced correctly. Sent it back and got a replacement - it also arrived with one broken strut. The plastic must be very weak so beware. Wouldn't recommend this for anyone backpacking etc.
__label__2 AbMat review: The AbMat is a good product for one that has lower back problems. Helps to reduce strain to the lower back. This particular AbMat is much harder than ones I have used. However, I would recommend it to those that need help with their lower back.
__label__2 No "School Boy Crush"?: How can they leave out their greatest and funkiest song School Boy Crush? I was really disappointed this song wasn't included. Nonetheless this DVD captures AWB in their prime
__label__1 Inconsistent performance: (+)Great price, high speed(-)HOWEVER before you buy this consider whether a cordless phone is used nearby. The DLINK card consistently drops connections when I use my 2.4 GHz phone even at 200 ft away. Yes, I should expect that due to the fact they use the same frequency but I NEVER experience interference with my 2Wire wireless card which was so much more reliant and is used at the same location. The DLINK card keeps dropping connections when the phone is used. It is incredibly frustrating and I am going to consider returning it.Third DLINK product I've bought, third satisfactory result from them. I've also used a total of 6 wireless cards and 3 wireless routers/access points. Although DLINK isn't at the bottom of the heap, it sure hasn't performed at the top. Checkout 2WIRE (hard to get retail) or Netgear's equipment.
__label__1 A practically useless software: Spamkiller downloaded all my e-mails from the mail server and checked the title and text of the messages for spams. This frequent process took up lot of time and it caught less than 1 percent of the spams. The update center was really annoying. I didn't pay much for the software, but it wasted my time and system time. The software was deinstalled after two weeks. I ended up using a free software 'mailwasher'. Mailwasher didn't catch most of the spams either, but it only downloaded the titles. I checked which are spams, which I need to read. The program deleted the spams on the mail server directly. The solution is not prefect but it helps. McAfee Spamkiller did nothing execept wasting time and resouces.
__label__1 Techniques borrowed from other books: Almost every technique I've seen in this book can be found in other books. I can't think of any off the top of my head that I haven't seen before. A good number of these are in Henderson's and Klein's books. I wouldn't waste my time with this one. Get the original source books, instead.
__label__2 Great Summer Read: The heart of this story is about the power of media influence in our society. Journalism is heavily influenced by many factors. LAKE NEWS brilliantly presents a story of the misuse and positive influence of journalism. The believability of the story, the characters, and the setting all add to how enjoyable this book is. Being a NH native I can attest to the truth of attitudes and language presented in the story. I love Ms. Delinsky's smooth writing style; it's effortless to read. A super summer reading choice.
__label__2 The best stuff ever: None of the stores around here carry unflavored protein, they're all loaded up with either sugar or some type of poisonous excitotoxin sweetener.This stuff rocks, you can mix it with just about anything like fruit juice or milk to make it more filling and nutritious.It dissolves easily and tastes good even without any sweetening. Highly recommended 5/5.
__label__1 If you have money to burn...: I love REM but this just wasn't worth the money. Don't get me wrong I love their music and I suppose I wanted to "collect them all" but this changed my mind about that idea. I'm actually upset that saved up for this. Forget about this import and just save your money for the next album.
__label__1 Teva Sandals run small...: I purchased the sandals for myself but was not able to wear them because they run narrow, I even went a size up because I have wide feet.. I ended up giving them away to someone with a narrow foot..
__label__2 I love it!: It arrived quickly, was a snap to put together, and comes with lots of attachments. I have bassets that really shed, this vacuum picks it all up, and quickly! It has sucked up stuff I had no idea was in my carpet, I'm very impressed. It is easy to dump, doesn't clog, and works well on my vinyl and laminate floors, as well as my carpets and rugs. It doesn't suck up throw rugs like my last vacuum did. It does have a harder time with the shag throw rugs, and does have a tendency to grab them. I turn the beater bar off and it solves the problem, it doesn't collect as much stuff, but freshens them up. I purchased a Dirt Devil bagless first, it was less expensive, and a piece of junk and waste of money. This vacuum is worth every cent!!!
__label__2 Gotta Be Google: At the moment the only real game worth playing is Google. No, I'm not a spokesperson for them but it is clear that if you're going to play you ought to play with the guys that own the ball. There is power in "Building Your Business with Google for Dummies". The best thing is that when you meet the Google criteria and succeed with them you can use the exact same business building blocks with any other resource. Brad Hill understands this and does a great job relaying his knowledge via the "Dummies" format. I'm beginning my second read-through. Thanks Brad.Larry J.

__label__2 Great Toy: My 8 mth old received this for Christmas (when he was 6 mths). He has always loved it. He will sit and spin it for 15 minutes straight. He hasn't been able to figure out the buttons for the letter sounds yet, but he will enjoy that when he's a little older.
__label__1 Am I the Only Person Disappointed by this Movie?: I liked EDWARD SCISSORHANDS and ED WOOD, both Tim Burton films starring Johnny Depp, and I suppose I was expecting something like that from this one. While it's visually interesting, like most of Burton's movies, and while Depp manages to amuse in a few places, on the whole this seemed like a very by-the-numbers horror/slasher film. Maybe a little more stylish than most, but nowhere near as eclectic and clever as Burton's other films. The scene with the cache of heads in the tree was all right, the scene with the little kid hiding under the floorboards was OK, the early fight scene with the still-capitated horseman was pretty good; but most of the movie threatened to put me to sleep. It's not a big deal that the story has little to do with Washington Irving or even the Disney cartoon, but you'd think the creators could have come up with something a little more original than a "Friday the 13th: Jason Visits The 19th Century" type story.
__label__1 Disappointing: Like many comic book fans familiar with comic book writer Garth Ennis collaborations with illustrator Steve Dillon, like John Constantine: Hellblazer, Preacher, or Goddess (an underrated graphic novel illustrated by Phil Winslade - I wish they'd reissue this one); I was really looking forward to this project. It promised to be a look at the dark side of the US Army's secret operations over an extended period of cold war history, told with Ennis trademark black humor and insight. But Unknown Soldier suffered from severe gaps in logic, in particular in the motivations and actions of its hero, the CIA agent who begins a hunt for the legendary Army Intelligence operative, the Unknown Soldier, and for me at least, was a disappointing read. Still, the Tim Bradstreet covers are excellent and are worth a peek, but other than that I can't recommend this collection.
__label__2 A fascinating key ...: Arguably controversial,Donald Tyson's treatment of the Holy Name and its magical implications and ramifications,with an extended reference to Enochiana cannot but act as a catalyst of ideas.Indeed,this is an unparalleled extensive treatment of the topic,while the author payed attention to the modern implications of the subject approached in his unique learned and critical manner.Whether one agrees with his assumption that the Enochian Keys are apocalyptic in nature-an interesting proposition in itself- has very little relevance;the merit of this book lies rather in its compelling ability of making the reader think and further explore the subject.
__label__1 could not get film to play!: I could not get this dvd to play, so I am unable to print a review. if you resend the film, and if i am able to access it, then i will review it.
__label__2 Great product at a great price: I had recently seen this product at a local store for $19. I then decided to check Amazon and found the same product for much less. After receiving the headset I have found it to excede my expectation and recommend it to anyone who is planning on buying a headset.
__label__1 Pump is disposable: This unit looks nice, and at first the pump was barely audible. Although my cat wouldn't go near it, I thought in time she would learn. Then the pump got loud enough that she was afraid to go near her food as well. There was enough water in the bowl but the pump struggled, and after a few minutes, failed to move the water at all. I'm not sure of the price of pumps, but I'm not about to buy a new one every 24 hours to keep this fountain running.Reading reviews of comparably priced fountains, it seems that quality is hit or miss -- mine missed. Take your chances and maybe you'll have better luck.
__label__2 Great: Ok, so this movie may have lacked a lot of elements that make movies great movies great, but it did have something most high-budget movies don't, a good plot. Ok, so I know it was about aliens who try to take over the world in a very inefficient way (the could only blow-up one building at a time) and lots of other things of that nature, but it did it in a believeable way. The actors held the script together. And maybe it was silly, but isn't that what movies are all about? Who wants to see a movie about how bad life really is?
__label__2 Interesting Australian Movie!!: Greta Scacchi stars as an Italian immigrant who falls in love with an Australian in the midst of a dockworkers strike using the italian immigrants as scab labor.It's an interesting Australian movie that's worth checking out!!
__label__1 YUCK!: I find these disgusting. Who came up with this?Even if I found the dolls acceptable (which I don't), they certainly shouldn't be pushed on young children. They'll be force fed enough pop culture as they get older.As a side note, does anyone else notice that the 5 star reviews for these dolls are barely readable?
__label__2 He's the best!: Kevyn Aucion is a true artist. He transforms people to the point where they look like a totally different person, in a good way! I wish I had his gift. He also gives step by step instructions on how to duplicate each look in real life. I love it!
__label__1 Uneven bevel: The jaws were ground unevenly and don't bite against the pivot. I have to move it to the tip to cut a wire.
__label__2 Great Scale: Very satisfied! I'm focusing on getting in shape and the scale is great for measuring various food products. Makes you realize what a true serving size is. The tare function is great for measuring things in bowls or adding to something that has already been measured. Highly recommend.
__label__2 An alcoholic hit bottom and remembering the past: This book is a new concept compared to Sheppard's usual fiction, in that it's a short book, almost like a long zine that you can buy for cheap and read in one pass. I read this during the New York blackout, and it hit the spot because it immersed me in another world, of a Navy dropout at the end of his rope, drinking mouthwash for alcohol and trying to think back as to what went wrong. It's like a good short story, but long enough that you get some detail and depth. I also like how he tied it into his book Small Town Punk, but also described another side of the Sarasota world. This is great stuff and well worth the sub-$$ price.
__label__1 Not appropriate for large skates: These consist of two pieces connected with springs. The instructions imply the pieces are long and should be cut to length. However the guards are too short for my size 12 skates leaving a 2+ inch gap where the blades are exposed.
__label__1 Should have been better: The premise of this book is interesting. Imagine a technology based on quantum mechanics that allows the viewing across time and space. First, there is no privacy and no secrets. How would society react to that? Second, imagine the technology allows the same access to the past. Did Jesus exist? Was Lincoln an idealist or a pragmatist?Within this intersting premise the authors use a shotgun approach to examine/trivialize the environment, religion, and a myriad of other subjects. The book is not focused (a typical problem with many cooperative ventures). Also, the book seems to be written to a high-school reader.An interesting story torpedoed by unfocused writting.
__label__2 A Love worth waiting for: 'When Andrew MacNeill married Gail he had made it clear that he did not want a wife but a mother for his children; he had not had the best of wives, and his experience of marriage had made him reluctant to trust, let alone love, any woman again.Gail had resigned herself to the fact that marriage was not for her, a terrible car crash had left her badly scarred, unable to have children, and had told herself that she had accepted Andrew's proposal because it would at least give her the chance of children - any children - to mother.But was either of them being completely honest about their motives?'
__label__2 Reminds me of the way books were written years ago.: I love the characters in this book and their resiliency in spite of the dark side of others and their bond to each other. I love to read historical novels to get a feel for what it was like to live in those times and this book satisfies in that area.
__label__2 Works as advertized: This unit works as advertised, and I was surprised to find that a USB bluetooth device for my computer came with this product as well. Both units work as advertized.Thank You
__label__2 Stargate- The Ark of Truth: Great fast passed and wraping up the unended story of the Ori. Dosn't let you down, worth it for any SG-1 fan.
__label__2 Very good as an orientation: I've been reading this book, and I find it very useful.It has given me a new point of view of what's e-business about, and how I can build better e-business web sites, with a different perspective. I recomend this book for everybody that's involved in the e-business industry, including developers like me.
__label__1 Awful Garbage: I bought this item a couple years ago. It is awful garbage. Did not work at all. It turned on but would do nothing. The instructions appeared to be a literal translation of korean.I instead upped my budget and bought an Insignia NS-dv2g and loved it so much I went back and bought the 4GB version. Best player ever, a definite ipod killer!you've been warned, stay away from the ninio.
__label__2 This book is a must for teenagers and teachers.: I read this book 25 years ago as a teenager. I decided to read it again because I saw a commercial advertising the movie on cable TV. Simply wonderful is all I can say. This is how a teacher should take care of students. Great read!!!
__label__2 Go see the show!: Just go see the show...it's really great, and you'll want the soundtrack after you see it.
__label__2 This is the greatest movie of the century....: This movie is an epic....and while, true, it does not meticulously keep with the novel, it is still the greatest love story of the cinematic "Hollywood glory days". Vivien Leigh is "Scarlett O'Hara", not only does she fit the description, she just becomes the character heart and soul. And there could absoulutely be no one else who could be Rhett but Clark Gable. The casting is perfect, the sets are so realistic, and the story moves along; even though it is four hours long, the movie just flies by. It is a classic, and should be seen by everyone who loves movies. This is the way movies were meant to be.
__label__1 Great easy to use: Havent used yet but plan on soon it looks easy to use and I will soon but just havent yet
__label__1 No genius here: I must say I am sorely disappointed. Although I agree that highly gifted children are poorly served by American schools, this book does them few favors. It is poorly written and marginally edited. Many of the arguments presented by the Davidsons and their writer fall flat or wander aimlessly. There are lessons to be gleaned from this book, but none worth the effort it takes to find them.Also, although the Davidsons would like to ignore it, the most literate society in the world, Finland, offers no special offerings to its gifted students.
__label__2 4 stars for price/quality, but 3 stars for quality alone: I bought this set to use as a gift because the price was too low to turn down. For young/beginning cooks on a tight budget, it's a very decent starter set and a good way to become accustomed to using straight-edge (versus serrated) knives in the kitchen. But these knives are made in China -- I wonder if perhaps there is just one big factory in Shanghai turning out dozens of brands. They will not come with, nor ever take, the same edge you get with Sabatier's made-in-France Grand Chef or Provence series, or with Wusthof's or Henckel's made-in-Germany knives.I strongly recommend hand-washing these knives. A few trips through a hot dishwasher might just peel the protective shiny coating from the handles. I think that, relative to their cost, these knives rate four+ stars. But head-to-head with other knives, including much-more-expensive ones, three stars is tops.
__label__1 Much too thin: These pants were so thin my husband refused to try them on and returned them. Held up to the light they were see-thru.
__label__1 Why would you make a game like this: I have seen bad games but, this just needs work.The battle system is horrible. The characters are ok. The way the begining starts is just stupid! What more can you say. All I can say is this game is no fantasy but it needs help.
__label__2 Love this thing: Low setting and a full tank will run for about 24 hours in my house and keep it very humid. I have a clock on my wall that shows the humidity level and this unit can humidify the largest rooms in my house with ease. Great tank, great humidity level settings. Trying to find another of this same unit!
__label__2 i have 55 bratz: when i got this toy i was so happy. it has so many clothes, heads, shoes, and more. i made 55 diffrent bratz with diffrent hair styles or even diffrent clothes and its so much fun. trust me youll play with this for a long time. gooooo bratz.(i hate to admmited but bratz copied my scene. i know its hard to believe but some of you KNOW bratz copied my scne and your just denying it. its okay, my scene copied bratz waaaaay more so my scene deserves a taste of their own medicine. go bratz.)
__label__2 What to Eat If you Have Cancer: This is a book that I would have liked to have known about whn I started undergoing treatment for Breast cancer. Have been going through Chemo treatments since September of 2005. Has been hard to find just what I should be eating to keep my energy level up and keep me going. This is a great book.
__label__2 Best New Artist in a long time: I can't get enough of the first song. This is the best new artist i heard in a very long time. There's only explicit lyrics in the first song. Just check it out, it's great
__label__2 Great price and works perfect: I paid less and got the exact same Tivo wireless adapter as sold by Tivo. I have had no problems and now I get updates and download shows to my computer without any cables..
__label__1 Are You Serious?!?!?!: If you think i am buying these box sets think again. They are a COMPLETE waste of money. I am gonna wait for the complete collection of Naruto to come out on dvd. It's bad enough that they made 10 of these. This is just insane.Overall Grade: F-
__label__2 Top-notch Watson: A great album. This is top-notch Watson. Top tracks: Torna a Surriento, That's Amore, Ave Maria, Nothing Sacred, The Pearl Fishers' Duet, Core `ngrato, The Living Years.... And my favorite "The Best That Love Can Be".DO NOT hesitate in buying this album.
__label__1 Pleasant collect for casual listening: A so so collection of World Music.Repeated listening highlights some annoying cliché tracks and others that are quite enjoyable.While not being a "must have' album, it provides an OK introduction to a variety of artists, which if you like can explore further.
__label__1 Wack: OKay rza did his job as far as the beats on diz album ? Classic but the lirycs ? Awfull... I got diz only enjoy the beats but cappa is horrible @ rhyming. Skip & copy gza's liquid swords or ghost's ironmman...
__label__2 Over a decade later. . .: I read this book when I was in middle school, and I constantly think about this book and the impact it had on me. It helped formulate my non-conformist attitude. And, without evening realizing it, this book sparked an interesting in Sociology, which I majored in in college. A definite must-read for young adults, in my opinion. I'll gladly put this on my bookshelf, and remember fondly for decades to come.
__label__1 Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!!!!!!: Run for the hills! This book is an abomination, a demonic tool, an attack on anything and everything DOOM. Instead of creatures of hell we have aliens, a cliche truly ancient, accompanied with abounding hyperspace tunnels, asteroid spaceships, and cloning vats. In addition, all of the "characters" save for the one from whom's perspective the story is told, are boring, thin, and generally stereotypical. Occasionally, there are some actual good scenes (usually outside of the main plotline), but that can proabably be credited to the HUGE gap in talent between the two authors. You can't really tell who wrote what, but even from the back cover, you can tell that one of the writers is mediocre, the other terrible. Perhaps deviously so...I have long been suspecting that this "novel" is in fact the product of a megalomaniacal AI computer, rather than an actual human.
__label__2 Joe Bonamassa / Beacon Theatre: Great DVD! The music is magical. Sound and video quality are very good. Wish I could get the music on a CD though.
__label__2 A Must Read for those participating in a start-up: I'm really glad I read this book while interviewing with a dot.com start-up. Helped me to ask many of the right questions, reassured me that the managment team knew what they were doing and helped me identify weaknesses that I would have to overcome for the company if hired. I was.A very easy, articulate and well thought out book. I encourage any and all. Money well spent.
__label__1 disappointed: Why would anyone put the on/off botton on the dog collar where the dog can turn it off??? Other than that it works good. When I need to use it, first I have to make sure he has not turned it off, test it, then I can use it. It seems to me that the on/off control should be on the controller...not the collar. and not where the dog can roll around and press the on/off button.
__label__1 Too Much Self-indulgent Tripe: There's some really good material in this book, but you have to plow through an awful--and I mean awful--load of self-indulgent tripe to find the occasional gem. When the chief authors aren't patting each other on the back and trashing the competition, they're staging made-up interviews with each other or writing about their dreams or other nonsense. The Montreal team essay is a rarity in that it looks in depth at something that actually happened on the field,an incident where a player loafed and cost the Expos a game and then was probably wisely traded. But there is just way too little of that. What there is instead is way too many stats that are difficult to understand or to read and too much from some writers who aren't all that impressive. Tom Austin is truly lame and his comments on what he thinks are the game's worst pitching seasons are sometimes almost laughable.
__label__2 Excellent for our use.: We have used this book for years to record our jobs....works great.Price was better than at our normal outlet.
__label__1 Not really worth it: It's a very quick read with some small interesting theories and tidbits but altogether very very out-dated and in my opinion, no longer has any relevant information to give today's actor. These techniques have already been surpassed and the book can be at times very stupid and quite sexist. It's really not worth your time or money. I would only suggest this if you were bored and wanted to kill some time on a long bus ride. But I wouldn't suggest that you take most of the things in this book into practice. Times have changed...
__label__1 Waste of Time: I have been listening to the book and been very disappointed.I am having difficulty getting past the narrator who assigns silly laughable voices to many of the characters.I will definately ensure that I do not listen to anything he reads in future.Now the story itself. I had thought that I was having difficulty following the characters and plot due to the bad reader.However, reading some of the other reviews I have to agree with most of them.The story is fragmented, has too many characters to follow and there are many instances that are laughably unbelievable.I will be careful in future when picking a Cussler book with a co-auther
__label__1 Warning: don't waste your money on this product: I wish I had read all the reviews before buying this product. I followed the manufacturer's directions. Each time I used it, the straps came out of the holes and ended up tangled with the rest of my laundry. Because of this tangled mess, the elastic got stretched out of shape in the back of the bra. This was a very expensive bra and I'm fortunate that I didn't ruin it. I will follow Nordstrom's recommendation and wash my bras by hand. I am a mechanical engineer by training so I know how to follow directions. The product is just very poorly designed and I wouldn't waste money on purchasing it.
__label__2 Great movie: I ordered this movie for the girls at work since everyone wanted to see it but the rental waiting lists were so long. I wasn't able to get anyone anything for Christmas so this was something I could do. Now everyone has been able to enjoy the movie.
__label__1 You have to be joking?: This book is a joke? Maybe.Maybe not. I think it is. I have lived on the Island, and never heard of any of the tales within this book. The author wrote or made up most of what is in it. The stories are false or taken out of context. I can't understand why anyone would want to publish false information like this.
__label__1 A book you'll want to forget...: I found the book's premise (and introductory chapters) to be somewhat intriguing. However, the plot became more implausible with each chapter until it lost its integrity altogether. What could have been an interesting novel turned out to be a far-fetched tale that left me shaking my head in confusion and disappointment.
__label__2 A good Introduction: There isn't much of the greatest of Nick Drake that isn't on this album, with the exceptions of 'Fly' and 'Rider on the Wheel'.This is a definitive statement of Nick's thorough grasp of melancholy beauty.
__label__1 Not what I expected...: Didn't like the videos. They were older than I realized and didn't really want my son watching it...mainly because of the dress of some of the kids in video.
__label__1 Terrible: Other one star reviews state the failings of this movie better than I could. I'll just say, hooray for motion sickness!
__label__1 Reads like it belongs in the 1970s: I found this book really preachy, like the authors think their audience is dumb and they need to teach readers about how bad the medical establishment is to women. I know that historically, women have been treated abominably by their own doctors, but we're living in the 21st century now, and many (most?) women are educated about how to watch out for good and bad treatment from their doctors. I felt like portions of it read like an early 70s feminist rant. (And I proudly consider myself to be a feminist.) I found all of that preachy attitude to be really unnecessary and unhelpful. Huge amounts of the book are dedicated to this, rather than towards how to actually maintain a healthy pregnancy and make natural choices. Plus, this book definitely takes the position that if you aren't doing it the author's way, you are doing it wrong.
__label__1 This one is disappointing...: Although I have thoroughly enjoyed other books by Jane Feather, I didn't like this one. I should have put it down when I first had an inkling of distaste because it wasn't worth my time. I read romance novels for that -- romance. I do NOT read romance novels for violence, especially violence against women. If you want to sleep with bad dreams, go ahead & read this one in bed. Otherwise, I recommend leaving it on the shelf.
__label__1 The Fly (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)I: I bought a used-very good copy from HiddenRiches?. I didn't know the case was going to be cracked!!!!!! I guess my opinion of very-good and there's is different.
__label__2 Great Mag.: There is great info in these mag's I read them from cover to cover. There issomething of interest for everyone and you can't price.
__label__1 Having trouble sleeping? Read this book.: Our Book Club made the mistake of selecting this book. The book is QUITE repetitive. Read the first chapter or two at the bookstore -- then put it back on the shelf; you will have gleaned all that is available. Sorry -- I don't want/mean to bash -- I just simply cannot recommend An Unquiet Mind.
__label__1 Not Fun: This was a horrible investment. It was not fun at all. It was complicated to use. Games that have the rumble feature do not fit well into the memory card and make it harder to use. The plastic split the first day I had it. I would not recommend this product to anyone, especially if you are buying it for a kid.
__label__2 Fiction Plane: Fiction Plane has to be one of the best cds i just randomly bought ever. I thought the cover looked interesting and it was cheap so i bought it thinking really nothing about it. I put the cd in and i was instantly addicted to it. I told all of my friends because it was just amazing i could not believe how good it was. Their lyrics rock and i really enjoy the "Cigarette" song. I was totally blown away by these guys and anyone who is looking to buy a cd should just stop and buy this one i promise you won't regret it!
__label__1 waste of time and money!: I have not heard this, but I'm assuming it is as bad as the other review describes.I don't know why there is even a market for these kinds of collections. Anyone with even a small investment to make can get great performances of "classical"music from labels like Naxos, Artenova/Allegro,Vox, Intersound (RPO's label),major label reissues and, of course, there's always used CDs.I almost never spend more than 5$, and often much less, for CDs with great sound and performances; and then there's MP3, if you are so inclined.So,If you care about hearing this music, as it should be played and recorded, spend a little money (and time checking reviews) and get the real thing.
__label__2 Worked well for a while....then died....but MY FAULT!!!: Bought this late 2008.....used it about 4 times. Nothing heavy...yard work with no more than an hour of total use. Took it out today to cut a fallen branch, plugged it in, pulled the trigger....silence. Absolutely nothing. Checked the extention cord...moved to another outlet, etc., so-forth and so-on. Another exception to the rave reviews I guess.....but it is over a year and a half old...so Poulan probably won't want to hear my story. A waste of $80 + tax in the long run.UPDATE 8/3/2010: Thanks to a comment posted with this review...and the fact I didn't chuck this in the garbage right away...I found out that there is an unobvious "safety" feature which shuts this down...which doesn't involve the main triggers you use with your fingers. See the comment posted with this review. I now give this saw 5 stars.
__label__1 Not for freezers.: I purchased this to track temperature swings in my freezer. Bad idea. The display was blank until I took it out of the freezer and let the unit warm up. The display started working once it got up to about 30 degrees. I am debating whether or not to keep the unit outside the freezer and break the seal by closing the door on the wires. Bottom line not for environments where the unit will need to be used in below freezing applications.
__label__2 Orange saute skillet: This is an excellent buy. It is sturdy, attractive, and just the right size for my cooking needs.
__label__2 Great seat, but make sure it fits in your car: This is a great carseat, it's one of the top safety rated seats, and that's why I got it. The only problem with it is that it's very large. We drive a Subaru Forrester ('02) and the only place the seat would fit was in the middle of the backseat. Now most of you know this is where they recommend you put a car seat, so it worked out fine, but you'll want to make sure this will fit in your car before you purchase.
__label__1 Amazon sent the wrong product: Amazon sent me the 32F46 not-flat CRT TV. They would not honor the price they advertised for the 32DF46. I didn't want what they sent me.
__label__1 Hated this thing: Directions were suspect at best, did not work for me at all, and overall I kind of watching to smash my head in after trying to use this thing.
__label__2 An inspiring, insightful work on many levels: Whether you feel like whipping up a fruit smoothie for health or ritually preparing a magical potpourri, this book is helpful. I love how accessible this work is--as a holistic health book AND herbal ritual book: both the beginner and expert can find useful, stimulating information inside.I welcome the range of cultural influence of the recipes, insight gathered from around the world, and extraordinary magic that can be used in everyday life! (This book makes me happy!)The herbal recipes generously shared here are expertly designed, easy to follow and result in DIVINE creations! (The Hara Ke potpourri is my FAVORITE!) In fact, both of the books by this author continue to inspire my personal herbal concoctions and magical endeavors.
__label__1 another thick useless book.: When will publishers learn that page-count is not THE sign of a good book - it's the content, stupid!this book is full of useless information. like reams of math equations that's useless to most casual readers and i'm sure too generic for the mathematically inclined.here's my ideal book...can someone publish a book that takes a newbie and tries to make him a real pilot - cessna is fine. let's get to step 1 first.all this in less than 100 pages. now i'd pay some money for that!
__label__2 Even prettier than I expected...: I was extremely pleased with the earrings that I received. I'm glad I purchased 2 pairs. I would DEFINITELY buy from earrings.com again.
__label__2 This is a very good introductory book on data mining.: If you are new to the field I definitely think this is a good introduction to the main topics revolving around getting more out of your data. It gives you a nice flavor of several techniques used throughout all process of knowledge discovery (and not only mining techniques). Moreover, if bought with the software option you can quickly try several methods on your data. The book is very easy to read in spite of addressing some though research problems.
__label__2 Very Inspiring: I, too, love this book. This woman dared to tell the emperor that he had no clothes when she fought for equal schools for everyone. She paid a heavy price personally but still maintained her position for what is right. This book should be required reading in high school!
__label__1 This Book Is Unreal: This book was a real disappointment to me. It is clear that it's written by the clergy and goes on as if everyone does exactly what they're supposed to do. Of course we know this isn't true for us lay people and it sure isn't true for the clergy either! To live up to our ideal is the goal, but everyone knows this isn't possible all the time Faith is a struggle. Catholics know this perhaps more than anyone--reconciliation is a sacrament! I recommend the Comnplete Idiot's Guide to Catholicism as it portrays the Catholic culture, what Catholics believe and what they do about their beliefs. It even covers places of disagreement among Catholics. Many people don't realize that Catholics don't all beleive the same way. The Idiot's Guide presented Catholicsim in all its lively fullness.
__label__1 One messed up book: This book doesn't give you the total info like a strategy guide should. It has millions of errors and some things aren't true like the fact that a cactuar can be morphed into a tetra elemental and a tonberry can be morphed into a ribbon. All in all you shouldn't waste your money on this you shhould buy a better one or print one off the internet.
__label__1 Author is a researcher only, do not be misled.: I am a law enforcement officer in Texas, a narcotic investigator, SWAT trained, and a LE sniper. I attended some tactical training and this book was recommended by the instructor. I was given the impression that Mr. Giduck was prior service military and had extensive training and experience dealing with tactical situations. I ordered and read the book, and while I learned about the awful attack at the Beslan School I am dismayed to find that the author is not likely qualified to advise the American LE community in dealing with situations like this.If you are looking for strictly the input of an academic researcher in planning and training for this type of scenario, I recommend the book. However, if you are looking for the perspective of a skilled, trained, and been there done that operator- you should look elsewhere.
__label__1 uh...: Though these pants look nice - they did not look nice on - material is too thin for my liking.
__label__1 Maybe he used a car...: After following this book from Malaga to Florence, it seems almost impossible that the author actually rode this route. He says that the trip can be taken by a person of any experience level, but realistically only an experienced rider would enjoy his route. He is consistantly incorrect with respect to elevations, distances, and major road names. After about a month of cycling we began to plan our own routes. We found that we could use a map and guess better routes than he could suggest in his book. Do not waste your time and money. Buy a good set of Michelin maps and pay attention to the topographical marks on the maps and you will be fine. Nothing is more annoying than to rely on incorrect information.
__label__1 WILDCARD - I THINK I JUST READ THIS: UNFORTUNATELY CHEYENE MCRAY ALREADY WROTE ZACK & LUKE WHICH ARE ALMOST IDENTICAL TO BOOK 2 & 3 OF HER WILD SERIES. I DIDN'T READ THIS ONE AT ALL CAUSE ONLY THE NAMES ARE CHANGE. SAD & I BUY ALOT OF BOOKS BUT WON'T BUY HER'S ANYMORE.
__label__2 Astonishing Debut Album!: Oh My God!! Sphere Of Souls!! Hailing from Netherland! Another Brilliant European Progressive Metal Band to surface. Unbelievable album, highly melodic with tons of progressive elements.. If you craved for more unique progressive music, this is it!! Wait no more cause SOS is taking you for a ride of a life time... Highly additive the minute the songs and music grows in you. I have nothing bad to say this is simply a feast for me! Enjoying it everyday since it was released! Surrender your soul to Sphere Of Souls. It will lift your spirit up to the cosmos!
__label__1 Review of DVD Black White & Gray: I did not care for this DVD for the fact that it was more about Sam Wagstaff's life prior to his relationship with Robert Mapplethorpe rather than a documentary about their time together. To me it touched on their life minimally. Patti Smith added some stories but I already read her view on their life in her book. Disappointed, not what I thought it would be.
__label__2 Great Story!: I liked the diary of a Worm. I like it because theworms put their head in and put their heads out. That's what I like. I like it when the spider's legs got stuck in the mud too. I love the men in black the most. I like it when the worm ate his home work aiot too. I like it when the worm is sitting by the big cheese box the best.I liked the story alot.
__label__2 Innate Savagery: Even though it's been years since I first encountered this novel, I still vividly recall the brave leadership of Ralph, the understanding innocence of Piggy, the thrill of the hunt, the smell of the pigs blood, and the intense primitive nature that takes dominion over the boys. The exploration of the various social interactions and the influence human nature has on them is intriguing and well delineated. However, the internal savagery that slowly and universally reveals itself amongst the characters proves to be the trues force which holds this novel high in my regard. Truly captivating and dangerously luring!
__label__2 GREAT for the inquiring sailor: This book povided us with many helpful sujestions and ideas on various subjects. It is great for the new-commer to sailing AND the experianced sailor. Recomended to anyone who is willing to improve!
__label__1 savages: movie was very boring,action was good, but not enough, will trade it in soon not worth keeping,endings were dumb. too many sex acts.
__label__2 Very entertaining: If you like movies like Snatch, In Bruges and Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrells be sure to check this one out too. Both lead characters turn in excellent performances.
__label__2 More fun than a pick-axe in the face!: Old-school, blood n' boobs slasher thrills meets sexy, new-age 3-D technology in one of the most entertaining theatrical experiences I've had in ages.The 3-D may not be as effective in the home, but even as a 2-D feature, this one is a lot of goofy, gore-soaked, guilty fun that harkens back to the glory days of body-count slash-a-thons.More remakes should be made with this degree of respect for the source material.
__label__2 Excellent book: This book was used as a textbook in one of my college classes through Regent University. The class, "Contemporary Problems for Christian Leaders," was very enlightening. The book covers world views in general and Christian world views specifically. As a Christian, my world view was transformed by this book, not in an earth-shaking way, but in a subtle way. Instead of Christianity being separate from "the world," I now see Christianity as redeeming the world. I would highly recommend this book.
__label__1 Convinced to pre-order the DVD boxed set: I agree with everyone here. I lived in Cincinnati during the time period the show was on in it's original form. I regret not taping any episodes. I had already moved away when it was reincarnated in the early 90's. I can't resist remembering my favorite episode and the gasping declaration by Mr. Carlson..."As God is my witness I thought Turkeys could fly!"Joe
__label__2 classic work, good guide: Moliere's play is of course a classic, and there's a lot you can get out of it. I like these student editions because they have some beginning info about context and style and extensive footnotes in the actual text to explain archaic vocabulary or references that the average English-speaker would not understand. It would've been a lot harder to understand the play without these helpful notes. Still, there were some times when the footnotes explained something that was obvious while neglecting something I found confusing. Overall, the best version for students of French.
__label__1 Not Very Good......: This is the worst book I ever read.The story was realy long andit didn't make sense at all!I give it two star because there was avery good plot but thats not what makes a book good all the time.I could see how some people might like this book so,you should give thought after reading this reveiw.Remember what I said though because it could make a difference. (if you think you might like this book don't let me stop you)
__label__2 One of the Best: Roger Waters, Stanley Clarke, Paul McCartney, Bill Wyman, Bohannon, Greg Lake...to name a few, in no particular order. Style, grace, creativity, innovation, entertaining, inspiring...to name a few, in no particular order.
__label__2 Fast Jacques indeed: Jacques Pepin - doing his French cooking thing- very fast indeed.Some very interesting and unusual menus- entertaining to watch but I probably won't try any of the recipes myself. I appreciate his teaching the details of his HOW-TO techniques and those I will try to implement myself. My only criticism is that I wish the disk had a "play all" feature. The commercials in each segment's opening can be by-passed by "fast forwarding" on your DVd Player. If you are a Jacques Pepin fan this beautifully filmed DVD won't disappoint in content and quality of programing.
__label__1 Poor quality Switch: Died today after under 2 years of service. That's pretty terrible for a basic piece of equipment. I have switches from 15 years ago that still work fine.Had to reset the switch fairly often(every 4 months or so). Drove me nuts making me think our DSl modem or Cisco router was buggy. Would work for a while and then just stop passing traffic.Buy from someone else.
__label__1 Ridicule from friends: Hired this out last Saturday night with friends. Terrible. We watched it all just for the sake of the memory of SS 1 but was really a waste of time. Don't ruin your memories - don't rent or buy! See other reviews for why.
__label__1 Problems with the actual recording...: I liked the music from Minority Report, but rather than talk about the soundtrack itself (because I figure you've seen the film otherwise you wouldnt be here, and you've got many other reviews here talking about the music) I'd like to mention the recording quality of the CD which is EXTREMELY POOR!I have an expensive stereo system and for a modern recording I was severly dissapointed in the quality of the mastering. It hisses, it pops, I thought I was listening to vinyl!!!! Maybe you can't here it on low volumes, or if other stereo systems have more bass which hide it? Personally, I like listening to my music LOUD and this recording SUCKS!
__label__2 Excellent for personal knitting and introducing newer knitters to lace: I am a fan of the "Folk" books and have several. The Folk Shawl book is easy to read, easy to understand, and gave me my first introduction to lace knitting. I was instantly hooked. I've knitted several of the shawls from this book and highly recommend it to anyone exploring lace knitting for the first time and as a tool to introduce newer knitters to this art. I've had great fun with Folk Shawls and have become a wearer of my shawls preferring them to sweaters.....they easily slip on and off and are a comfort in the cold weather. I even knitted a heavier version of the larger Stora shawl out of worsted weight wool and wore it as a substitute for a coat over an alpaca sweater!Thank you Cheryl Oberle for a wonderful book!
__label__1 Too much to pay, get a normal speed networking book: The author aims for a neat look and straightforward diagramsbut as soon as i got to chapter 4, i am confused. I am not an industry expert but ATM doesn't seem a viable long term technology. If other people think the same way, why does the bookdescribes it in a positive way ?? The rest of the book then goesmore into theory and normal networking concepts that you canlearn from a probably cheaper, "normal speed networking book" ?Overall, if you already have a networking book, let's sayfrom Tannenbaum or Comer than i don't think this book is a viable"second networking book" option.Cheers, Zoltan
__label__1 Loss Leader: When Gilette invented the safety razor in 1902 he practically gave them away. This was because he knew he would make much more money selling the blades. The tactic was called a loss leader. That's what Canon is doing with this printer. The ink is very expensive and produces fewer prints than any other printer I have ever owned by far. My printer is still working well but I'm throwing away this otherwise OK machine because I can't afford to feed it.
__label__2 Music that gets you through the day...: This album is hot, when I first heard the song Lo Hechamos A Suerte I couldn't get it out of my head--my friends and I couldn't stop singing it! The lyrics to these songs actually make sense, and they're poignant without being mushy and overboard. Their voices are an awesome, grooving blend that'll take you from one mood to another. Great variety on just one CD!
__label__1 Overrated underperformer: This is NOT the best of both worlds; in fact, it's not good as either a slant or a point tweezer. The pointy end doesn't work at all. The slanty side doesn't grab the hair. I don't mind paying good money for a good tweezer but this one is two thumbs down. (I tried to give it zero stars but the lowest the system accepts is one.)
__label__2 Some dry - er, wet - British humor for your amusement: "Flushed Away" is a light but entertaining animated adventure set in a surprisngly antiseptic version of the London sewers. Top-notch visuals and endless sight gags save a fairly thin and predictable story line (think "The African Queen" crossed with "Romancing The Stone," and with gender roles reversed). Not as charming as "Curse of the Were-Rabbit," but passable entertainment for kids and parents alike.
__label__1 Vaio Premium Horrors: I was reasonably happy with my premium SZ260P despite some misgivings about the keyboard and the heat generated by it.Within four months, keys on the keyboard have begun to fall out. Problems with the spacebar have been well documented...all in all, the build quality has basic design faults despite the beautiful screen and efficient processors etc.Given that the new Core 2 range also use these keyboards, one couldn't recommend VAIO SZ's as long as the keyboard is made so cheaply. Also watch out for the fact that despite the thinness of the machine, the AC adapter is gigantic!
__label__2 Reborn -- Definitely!: I've always been a huge Stryper fan if for no other reason than they brought an 80s Hard Rock sound to Christian music. I think those who can get past the nasally voice of Michael Sweet will love this album. It has brought the band up to date with some harder tracks without failing the signature Stryper sound. There are some really good tunes on this album along with one or two just okay songs. A Stryper fan will not be disapointed with this CD.
__label__1 You cannot be serious!: This is absoloutely dire. I've tried several times but can't get past the first 3 scenes. I'm glad I read the play before watching this or I would have been put off forever. To say it's a modern adaptation doesn't really describe it - it's more like a pantomime version with Montagues and Capulets not just as rival gangs but as owners of the town, with their respective names in lights on tall buildings. Its only insight is into the producer's self-aggrandisement. Yuk!
__label__1 Bissell does not back this product; did not work on arrival!: I read all the reviews before finally deciding to purchase this vacuum cleaner. After using it a few times and thinking it was not very effective, I realized the rotating brush did not rotate. I called Bissell and they wanted me to pay for a new brush even though I had only had the vacuum for a month, because "the brush is a wear and tear item and not covered by the warranty." I insisted on speaking with a manager because I couldn't see how my brush could be damaged by "wear and tear" in only a month, and was finally told they would send me a new brush. In 7-10 business days. So I can't vacuum my floors for 7-10 days. With 5 cats and a newborn, this is not acceptable to me. My advice would be to buy from another manufacturer. I don't feel Bissell was very willing to help me with their defective product.
__label__2 Yes, he can!: After Mr Obama's inauguration which the writer must have foreseen as the first edition of the book has been published in 2005, there is only one question to be answered: Will the new U.S. president really be up for radical change or is he only a charming alternative [...]? Will he have the philosophical capacity and political wisdom to meet Penguin-President Charly and negotiate the purchase of a new planet? If not so, how come that during Mr Obama's first week a record number of civilians were killed in Afghanistan while the peace-loving black president announced to increase troop deployment to secure American pipeline-interests in Pakistan using the Mumbai attacks as a perfect excuse, oh boy!!!
__label__2 One of my favorites: I am a junior in high school. When I first read The Fountainhead, it was like a revelation for me. I thought that my life was basically meaningless as it was, and to truly experience enlightenment I must learn to be "selfish". However, that initial passion has since faded, and I can now step back and see some of the fallacies of the book. Although great in concept, Objectivism, as the extreme opposite of Communism, may work in much the same way. I also noticed that characters in Rand's books (I have read Atlas Shrugged, Anthem, and We the Living), especially the female characters, are fundamentally very similar, both in appearance and character. This does not detract from the books' overall appeal, but does take away a little of the mystery and intrigue. I love these books though, and while not agreeing totally with every aspect of Rand's philosophy, I appreciate the beautiful workmanship of her writing.
__label__2 WHAT???: My goodness. Why do sellers charge so much for a used apple shuffle when you can go to Walmart and purchase a brand new one for much cheaper or a used one from Ebay for almost half the price. Come on sellers, get real! Some of us are not fooled.
__label__2 Good read: Enjoyed seeing Harry grow and develop some self control. Will be interested in learning how his marriage goes in later books.
__label__1 Good for diving only...: The watch hands are virtually indistinguishable at night, making it a poor choice. Good dive features, but I found the dive mode would automatically enter if I went jogging (sweat will activate it). It also goes into dive mode in the shower...not a good design. There ought to be some way of telling the watch, "I'm at the ocean, NOW you can start dive mode."If you want a watch ONLY for diving, this is a good choice. Otherwise, steer clear!
__label__2 Interesting Transformation...: ...both physically and emotionally.Yes, the author is hard to like at times, but at least it is honest, rather than asugar-coated version of her personality. Personally, I found her to be a bit harsh at times, but I have never been overweight, so I can't judge her too much.The recollections of her childhood and the period before she started her diet were the most interesting and poignant to me. I think a little something was lost towards the end of the book.
__label__1 Is it really Faberware?: I suppose this tea pot works well enough but I am somewhat dissapointed. No where on the box does it say Faberware, I think this may be a knock off. It doesn't whistle very well at all because the whistle part does not sit against the teapot securely enough as the weight doesn't hold it against the teapot securely enough. It doesn't hold very much water either. If you try to put more water in it, the water bubbles out the top. All in all it works to boil water but it was not worth the money and as I said, I don't think it is a genuine Faberware product.
__label__2 Ultimate bread-maker: I purchased this as a gift for my wife as her old machine is slowly falling apart. She is very happy with this machine and is especially fond of the ability to add fruit, nuts, etc. during the process. We really do enjoy the great things that she bakes and makes with it and we have the satisfaction of being able to use all natural ingrediants, stone ground flour, etc. and eliminate a lot of the preservatives and chemicals found in processed foods.I would recommend the purchase of this machine or one like it by this manufacturer. It is of high quality and the fit and finish are pleasing and excellent.
__label__1 DULL DULL DULL: This was definitely NOT a page turner. I tried for 100 pages to get into it. Grant it, if a book takes too long for it to grab me, I'm done. However, this book just was sooooo boring. The author tries to describe everything in EVERY detail. How many words can you use to describe a blue sky??? Just describe it and move on already. I usually try to finish a book, but I just could not get through it.
__label__2 A little tight, but works pretty good.: I bought this because our brand new car has a light colored interior, and I didn't want the junk from the street getting all over it after we used our stroller. It's essentially a canvas bag with a zipper on top, which means that the sides don't stand up on their own. Also, our Graco stroller is a bit tight in it, and it takes some work to get in in the bag. All in all, though, it gets the job done.
__label__2 A nice break from batteries and flashing lights: Not a whole lot to say except that what you see is what you get. It's well put together, which I've found is always the case with this brand. My daughter is on the young side of the age range for this product, so I've been controlling her access to the toy screwdriver -- a little pointy -- but that's not a flaw in the product by any means.
__label__2 The Change Was Good: Air Supply proved that change can be good. Although they certainly did have a good sound with their light and "airy" hits from the 70s and 80s, this album signaled a radical departure for them. It is more creative and features much better material. Songs such as "She's Got the Answer" and "Dancing With the Mountain" are great examples. Creative, melodic, and featuring a good use of both vocalists. Russell Hitchcock is obviously the better of the two, but the switching back and forth was used very effectively on this effort! Even the rather syrupy "The Earth Is" is an enjoyable "anthem" to save the earth. All in all, with this album, Air Supply became a much more interesting album, and paved the way for their future efforts, culminating in their finest effort, "The Vanishing Race." If you like "The Earth Is," you'll really like "Vanishing Race."
__label__1 Not Happy: The shoes were not as they were described.I just was not happy with them at all and they were to tight in the toe for my 4 yr old.
__label__2 The Bass King reigns!: I would have bought this album for the first song, "Bass King", alone. Mr. Kumalo was the bass player on Paul Simon's Graceland and you'll recognize the quality of playing. What keeps this CD in my player is the artful blend of african and jazz. I like African music from S.E. Rogie to Ali Farke but what I like about this album is that a joyful sound is being laid out with timeless musical, not African, appeal. I don't always enjoy being given "a lesson" in some sub-catagory of African music at the expense of an artist streching out. There is an complex effortlessness to these soothing tunes, but put your headphones on and the subtle buildings of rythms and harmonies... wow. This is one of those albums that sounds fresh even after a number of listenings, that's why I gave it a five.
__label__2 Joan Hess via Claire Malloy is delightful.: I have loved all of her books. Claire Malloy is delightfully nosy, the subject matter informative and the plots truly mysterious. Her relationships, like most, leave something to be desired.
__label__2 WARNING - The Bonus CD is "New Recordings": I was pleasantly surprised to find a bonus CD with this set . . . until I realized that these are "new recordings". If you want the original songs, you'll need to find them elsewhere (or snag them from the DVD audio).
__label__2 Excellent Fryer: I bought this Fryer to make French Fries at a small food concession I have. Wow! It did a beautiful job on the fries and with the two baskets there's no hold up on customer orders. The fries are done in about 5 minutes and the customers love them. I wish there was a more effective way to clean the elements, but with the ease of using the fryer, I'll make do with carefully wiping it down with a sudsy cloth.
__label__1 Terrible book: I was very excited when I found this book, it sounded interesting and so full of potential. I struggled to read it. I really wanted it to be good but at best it was boring and at worst it was vulgar. Do not waste your time or money on this sorry excuse for a book.
__label__2 Great!: This documentary type movie was very informational, funny and worth the money. Michael Baisden is truly an idol and know what really needs to be addressed.
__label__2 Fine item - great for first aid kit & hiking: I have a couple of tubes of anti-biotic ointment around the house - but I really like these individual packets better for hiking and backpacking. I carry a first aid kit when I'm hiking in the mountains, and these are easy to stash just about anywhere.
__label__2 THIS IS ONE FOR THE RECORD BOOKS, Big Ups to Haystack !: You want some REAL music to ride to, this is it! MY brother-in-law and I sell cd's in Wichita, KS and are heading to expand to K.C. I promote Haystacks cd the most to people. I want to back the REAL whiteboys up when I can. Eminem is cool but different style and I personally feel that Haystack hits home to me more then Eminem did. I'm about lyrics and beats not one or the other and Haystack brings both every time. TELL EVERYONE ABOUT THIS CD!!!!!!
__label__1 Incredibly Stupid... Don't Waste Your Time: Understand that this is "based on a true story" but honestly, who cares? The film certainly doesn't make you care - there is absolutely nothing redeeming about it. Do not waste your time if you already know that there are sad, uneducated sheep in this world who have been conditioned to follow any rando claiming to have authority.
__label__1 Gizmo Grater: Unfortunately, I didn't read any reviews on the Gizmo Grater. Had I read anything about it before trying it out, I would have not bought any. I bought a total of 6 graters to give as gifts. Two told me it is not good for soft cheeses. We use a lot of cheddar cheese for tacos. What a waste of money. It worked very good with parmesan cheese which is hard. That is why I gave it 2 stars. Other than that, thumbs down. Perhaps I should send the two back that I haven't given as presents.
__label__1 Awful.... simply awful... can I give it -stars???: I was required to read this book for a class and was very upset after every reading session. The authors breed hatred and contempt for other races regardless of the culture of the reader. There are NUMEROUS unsupported statements of fact, and countless radical opinions. Worst $3.00 I have ever spent... seriously...
__label__1 No pictures!: The only picture in this cookbook is on the cover. This was very disappointing to me. I like to get a visual on what I'm eating before I cook it. I love looking at the pictures of recipes and in this cookbook you'll find none. Other than the lack of visuals I can't complain.
__label__1 SLOW MOVIE: VERY SLOW AND NOT VERY WELL DOCUMENTED///IF YOU KNOW THE REAL STORY YOU WILL FIND THE MOVE JUST THAT A MOVE//
__label__2 Cant go wrong for under 3 bucks!: Let's face it, there are quite a bit of ridiculous reviews out there, some with far-fetched claims, but when you have a FIVE pack of Lithium Cell batteries for a few measly bucks, there cannot be a whole lot negative about that!With that said, These batteries are fresh, with a 2016 expiration date. They work as batteries should, enough said. If your on the fence whether or not to shell out 3 bucks for a FIVE pack of batteries, maybe you don't need 'em after all! ;)
__label__2 Gripping, exciting and action packed.: This is one of my most favorite books of all time. The incredible story of the connection between our world and the realm of glimpses. The twists and turns, the interesting characters and the hordes of demons that encompass the story bestow a prominent yearning to read until physically impossible to continue. I strongly suggest you check it out.
__label__1 Way too long and wordy: This book is way too long and way too wordy. It could easily be about 1/4 the size. I think the content is fine, but quite tedious to read all the babble to get to the point. Also, the book is far too light on illustrations. I recommend skipping this book and get the DVD.
__label__2 better than gossip girl: Much better than gossip girl. All the brand names and restaurants and characters which just talk and do things, like real life, no back stories and development. The killing and torture scenes i found too scary and unpleasant to read much of, but they puncture the high price banality of consumption, a kind of ultimate exploitation. Conceptual and very smoothly written with LOL moments. A masterpiece, perhaps.
__label__1 Powder was caked solid and unusable.: I purchased 8 boxes of Glass Magic and every box was caked solid like a brick.I contacted the manufacturer (Reckitt Benckiser)and they agreed to send a voucher for the damaged product.Trouble is, Glass Magic isn't sold locally like at WalMart, so the voucher will be difficult to redeem.Reckitt Benckiser said they would mail me 1 box but for the other 7 boxes a voucher would be issued after they received the Amazon invoice.Every box was wrapped in it's own plastic bag so I don't know why it caked. But that would indicate that they are aware of the problem.
__label__1 Quite possibly one of the worst games ever made: Really nothing more to say. Not even worth the $1 I paid for it.
__label__2 crunk a$$ $hit: this cd is off da chain from the first track to the last. the beats are strait out the south, and the flows are tight as hell. go check this joint. if u from the south, or like southern rap style, this cd will keep u crunk.
__label__2 Wise and humane: An enjoyable read, "Plainsong" compassionately looks at the verities of life - the good and the bad. Haruf write with a realistic, yet kind and graceful, style that ultimately leaves one with hope.Interesting to hear that this will be a Hallmark movie in November. This book isn't sentimental and I hope that will be true of the "Hall of Fame" special on CBS. The casting of Aidan Quinn and Rachel Griffiths is promising.
__label__2 The John Mayer's Band...: ...John Mayer is becoming a household name now. A touch of rock, jazz, and folk all combined into one CD. Songs like "Your Body Is A Wonderland" and "No Such Thing" reminds me that there is still good music out there. This is an original.
__label__2 Halfway through and addictive: Well, what I think of this book is amazing. It's for the older-than-Tolkien-older-than-J.K. Rowling crowd, most definitely. And it's also a great book for people who wish to switch over from strictly SF to fantasy or strictly nonfiction to fiction.I like how they stick an ordinary man, Rand al'Thor, into the midst of the extraordinary. Although this is a long book, it is SO worth reading, especially since you can trace parallels b/t this and the real world, and also b/t this and other fantasy/SF series and Japanese manga. :)The only reason this gets a 4 in place of a 5 is the gender politics. You can make of it what you will, but obviously men are the villians here, and, unfortunately, it's beyond their control due to the tainted nature of saidin, the male magic. But I suppose that this is a mirror of the real world for the male writer, being the pawn of women.Overall, a great book.
__label__1 Madonnna Cone Bra!: Please don't listen to the other reviewers if you are well endowed! This bra does fit well and hold you in, but it gives you cone boobs! That is not a look that I am going for and as such I'll be returning my purchase.
__label__2 Same SD card as all the others. Great Price: I bought this for my son's MP3 player and it works great. No problems and no speed issues. Great Price....
__label__2 The Verve Pipe Rocks!: The Verve Pipe has released its' best album to date! Every song on this album is amazing. There is not a mediocre song on the album and I found it hard not to sing along with every song. The new self-titled CD has been the only thing I've listened to for the past week and I don't intend to stop anytime soon. The Verve Pipe has found a way to effectively mix slow songs, such as 'Kiss Me Idle' and 'Half a Mind' with rockin' songs such as 'Hero' and 'Generations.' 'Television' is awesome and anyone hearing the chorus would be unable to resist screaming it aloud with Brian Vanderark. Pick this album up! It will definitely be one of the best albums of all time for me.
__label__2 Nice humidifier: We were looking for a filter less humidifier as the previous unit we had the filters would get very funky. This SPT unit is filterless and so far (3 months) the unit has worked flawlessly. Occassionally we do clean the unit but it is very easy to clean. We haven't found the filling of the resevoir to be a problem. Many people wrote complaining that the handle is under the resevoir when you fill it, but if you can't turn the resevoir over to grab the handle then you need to go to a doctor and get your hand strength tested. We use filtered water from our osmossis unit and the scale or white dust has not been noticed. Also we live in Nevada, dust doesn't bother us. We haven't used the heat setting so no opinion there, but as other review said, DON'T over tighten the lid. Just snugg it tight and the o-ring will last.
__label__1 Limited Lifetime: Not worth the money spent. At 2 years a leak was discovered. Repaired and at three years another leak was found. Replacing with another brand. (Stiebel)
__label__1 VENDOR MAKES SIZING TOO COMPLICATED.: I HAD TO VISIT THE VENDORS SITE TO KNOW WHAT THE LETTERS A, B, C ,D CORRESPONDED TO SIZE-WISE. I ENDED UP HAVING TO EMAIL THEIR CUSTOMER SERVICE BECAUSE I COULDN'T FIND THE INFO ON THE SITE. I GAVE UP ON CUSTOMER SERVICE AFTER 2 DAYS OF NO RESPONSE AND ENDED UP ORDERING THE WRONG SIZE.
__label__2 Do not be fooled...: This dvd is really good, The boys dont come off as bevis and butthead thats just how they are very down to earth and feel comfortable with their music. And the deftones are the furthest thing from the tag the media has adopted "NU-METAL" they are in their own zone with metal influences but by no means should be labeled with bands they have seperated themselves from ie: Korn, slipknot, limp triscut etc.. My advice is by this dvd if your a music fan cause thats all it is and all it will ever be
__label__2 Ambitious. Smart. Duplicitous. Great Read!: This makes for one heck of a read. Finished it over three day vacation and am now looking forward to the epic battle to come in 2008. I've read everything on President Clinton, and there is, contrary to these other reviews, quite a few previously unreported details. But, one must actually read the book to make an informed decision. And I suggest you do!
__label__1 It's not an article, it's a pointer: A waste of money. Don't read this for any information on quail habitat.
__label__2 I hate to gush, but...: it must be done. This album is sublimely strange and beautiful. Murphy's voice is liquid elegance. I want to tell everyone I know how delicious this album is and that they must partake in this sumptuous audio-indulgence, but I thought I would start here. If that's not a winning endorsement, I don't know what is.
__label__2 By far the best of the 3 Mike Welch CD's: Mike's finally finding his own voice. He's singing and writing much better than he ever has, and his guitar playing, which was already good if too excessive, has gained a new maturity and sense of taste. A lot of the songs aren't blues - a little too pop - but the ones that are are as good as any. He even writes good pop tunes.
__label__2 Best Dog Disc: I could not say anything negative about the Dogobie discs. Our dog Patch (border collie)loves them. They outlast other discs and are soft enough that they will not damage his teeth. They do take a beating.. Thanks so much.
__label__1 very sad: you can tell that the show in dubling was great, exciting and beautiful, and you wished you were there, but watching this video just makes you wanna talk to those who made it. you want to see it so much....and you cant!!!!!!the only thing you see is the camera changing constantly and some feets....you dont see the beautiful dance and the whole experience from watching this dvd is DISAPOINTING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!if you like the irish dance this dvd is unuseful......it is horrible and makes you very mad because you want to see it so much and can't and can't do anything about it either!!!!!dont buy it, waste of money and energy!
__label__1 Disease garbage world: What a terrible, wretched idea for a film. Here's an idea - make a movie about trashy photographers who hunt trash for a living and end up with a movie that is pure... trash. This is a symptom of a Cultural disease that set in sometime in the late nineties. I don't eat garbage for a living, I don't think you should either. Pass on this one if you have a soul, an intellect, or a drive toward any sort of greatness.
__label__2 Finally ! an intelligent, honest view of motherhood: With wit and verve and no axe to grind Faulkner Fox shows what contemporary motherhood is really like. Fox's descriptions of the everyday anguish and elation that is motherhood are powerful and refreshing. It will be a relief to many mothers and fathers alike to have an accurate, readable, and humorous look at parenthood, without the usual pedantic, religious fervor (either to the right or the left) that most books on this topic betray. This is a must read book for parents-to-be, parents in OJT,and grandparents who are trying to think of some way to help. Buy it for all your friends.
__label__2 sharp enough to shave with: i just bought this knife and right out of the box i was able to shave some hair off my arm with it and it is the perfect size in my hand and it is a good, solid knfe overall that i plan to extensively use in the future
__label__1 Just Awful!: This is a terrible product. I agree with Whit. Condensation is unbelievable! Even with the darn thing wide open at the head! The Goretex is awful. Go with eVent fabric...
__label__2 best rap cd in a while: this is tight, My favorites are I wanna see with quik, and hi c, and gone with sugafree and james debarge, i love those 2 jams. Dj quik once again proved to be a top notch producer who does'nt get his props...good rap blazin cd ecerybody outta get R.I.P. mausberg.
__label__1 The Templar Continuum: Rarely do I begrudge the money spent on a book but this attempt at a new theory for the origins of the Templars is sorely lacking in content. Without any footnotes and no index or bibliography I found trying to accept the authors' theories was a hard pill to swallow. This book deserves only two stars for the interesting ideas that are proposed - certainly not for the amateurish way in which they are presented. The many typo errors only add to the uncomfortable feeling that this entire effort was concocted in someone's garage and thrown out to the public at an outrageously high price.
__label__2 Wonderfully done. The best around.: The most comprehesive and cool guide to the coolest space movies, books, etc. Round of applause and thanks to the author.
__label__2 Wonderful!: Thoroughly enjoyed this version and highly recommend it. We missed the first season and are happy to have this for our collection.
__label__1 Don't Waste Your Money!: The only good thing about this turkey (and why I have even given it one star)is due to the video,because the audio is awful! It is as if microphones were set up in different parts of the venue in order to capture the audio.Do not,I repeat,do not waste your money. (I hope that Gerry,and Dewey have not watched this turkey)Sol
__label__2 cat's love it: Cats love this food and I'm glad she can hold it down with a uneasy stomach. Always used grain free and they love this brand.
__label__2 Better than that "biggest loser chick": Im selling most of my other workouts!I swear!Jari`s workouts are all you need.I recently purchased Ripped 1000 and liked it so much that I bought this one.I`ll be using them both weekly.I was`nt this sore doing P90X.I feel confident that these dvd`s will help me reach that ripped look that I`ve been trying so hard to get.
__label__2 Awesome Book: I bought this book because I was transitioning from working mom to stay at home mom and needed some encouragement and guideance. This book is wonderful! Very good advice and offers a great perspective on the importance of the job "mom" as well as it's ups and downs and how to deal with them.
__label__2 all our lives: This is not a 'coffee table' book, but one which requires serious thought and study. Ostensibly about clear cutting in Oregon, it is a commentry on our world and what we are doing to it. He does offer hope but it is a thin one. It should be essential study for all photographers involved in environmental photography, in fact anyone concerned with our present attitudes to the world we all live in. Robert Adams most important book yet,but a demanding book to 'read'.
__label__1 Dull Writing: This book lacks the charm of Tuesdays with Morrie. The writing is flat and the story is rather old. The author has reworked material from Its a Wonderful Life, so the idea in the book is not original. Perhaps when the author meets his maker he can explain to the five people he will meet why he wrote this book, since the reason is not present in the text.
__label__2 Favorite pencil: Started back to school again this semester and decided to stock up on pencils. This particular pencil has been my favorite for years. I've bought more expensive (refillable) pencils but did not like them as much.I have carpal tunnel syndrome so after a lot of writing my hand starts to cramp up. I guess these fit my hands better and unless I'm writing for hours I have no problems with them.Also, I wanted to note that even though I've used other pencils with 0.7mm lead these seem to be sturdier and do not break as often.I did get one bad pencil out of the bunch. The lead would not stay in the pencil no matter what I did. Then without warning the whole thing fell out. But, that is only one out of close to 30 pencils so I won't complain.
__label__2 The Best Mortal Kombat EVER!!!: I think this movie was better than the first one with all the action in the fights and that there were more characters. The special effects were awesome! Nuff said! BUY THE MOVIE!!!!!!1
__label__2 Dirt - Ashes to Ashes ...Dust to Dust...: Dirt is the fabric of life and the quality of that dirt is reflected in us as human beings. We grow food in the soil and if it is depleted then so are we nutritionally speaking. It talks about the relationship of soil to our well being. I highly recommend watching it to see for yourself. People from all walks of life are featured in this video. Mother Earth provides well when she is nurtured and cared for by us the people who inhabit this planet Earth.Take a walk in nature and compare that to the concrete jungle. Which do you prefer?
__label__1 Characters In Search of a Plot: As an avid reader of fiction and non-fiction about the transracial adoptive experience, I was immediately drawn to the subject matter of this book. However, I was disappointed and surprised at how the author failed to create momentum or at the very least, a forward moving plot. Much description was given with no action, mainly reading like the background biographies of the characters rather than details that are integrated into a developed story. Most distressing is the lack of three dimensionality to the children themselves, a list of physical attributes and behavioral tics do not make them come alive. I am a true sucker for any kind of family formed by adoption story, let alone one with the outlines of this book as it mirrors my own family, but the fact that I didn't feel moved at all signals to me, an unconvincing and inauthentic rendition of this experience.
__label__2 Excellent resource!: This book is a visual encyclopedia of Native designs, from prehistoric to recent history. Tribal art and artifacts are covered from all over, for example, there are images and sketches of Navajo sandpaintings, Eskimo clothing, Pueblo pottery, plus masks, belts, and even just basic designs! If you do beadwork, quillwork, pottery, or other Native arts, this book is a must for your library!
__label__1 Poor Product, Poor Customer Service: I don't recommend Garmin products or their customer service personnel. I would advise using a different vendor.
__label__1 Wild Hype: This ABC produced mess was hype without substance. It passes for edgy intelligent techno whatever because it was aimed at the great middle brow. It is Oliver Stone trading on his name and rapidly falling clout. This thing was produced in the shadow of JFK and the afterglow of Natural Born Killers, or back when people still thought Oliver Stone had something to say. After U Turn, Any Given Sunday and Alexander, most of us know better. Oliver Stone is a Tony Scott level director with sophmoric political insights. Finding anything deep in this made for TV event is like championing 12 Monkeys over the films of Chris Marker
__label__2 Cult Classic.......: Dark comedy but such a good movie....The War of the Roses....if you take it seriously you may find it depressing....Great acting by Douglas Kathleen and DeVito!~
__label__1 Good concept, but it's just a disappointment: The scanner has to be perfectly lined up with two tiny triangles and on a flat hard surface to work (according to the instructions). What little kid can do that??? We are very disappointed, and our son get very frustrated that the scanner does not announce the correct items. In my opinion, this toy is really a piece of junk.
__label__2 Good stand up job: This product was produce by Monte Cook and Colin McComb the 2 heavy weights of the Planescape Campain. Most the really Good products have there name on the cover. Building on the format used on Planes of Law they produced a good soild product that really is useful and easy to use for the DM. I run planescape own all of the books and I still use this product. That says some thing.
__label__1 very, very average...: If your looking to be entertained by action and suspense, U571 is up your ally. But for those of us who demand more from a war film, this work sadly will come across as an American ripp-off of Das Boot, especially intended for audiences that are not familiar with the latter masterpiece.
__label__1 Great Musical - Bad Adaptation: THE REASON I AM REVIEWING THIS IS BECAUSE IT WAS RECOMMENDED BY AMAZON TO ME AND IS FOR THOSE WHO HAVE IT RECOMMENDED BUT HAVE NOT SEEN THE FILM.I had listened to the Julie Andrews, Richard Burton, Robert Goulet cast album and loved the score. I finally got a chance to see the film and it was unbearable.I would say that it is the cast - most have never been in a musical and never have done a musical again. But I saw Richard Harris do it on stage and he was brilliant.I have to put the blame on director Joshua Logan. Logan was one of the greats of Broadway and Hollywood but at times he got caught up in the luxury of the movie (look at South Pacific). And this film is overly luxuriant.If you are a fan of the show then try and find the Showtime production of the Richard Harris stage production. This was a beautiful filming of a stage show.
__label__2 great book: this is the best book i have ever read. it is a laugh out loud book for girls of all ages. although it is not exactly a boy book. it may have one or two bad words but the funny parts make up for that.
__label__2 Pretty Cool! Buy if you like rpg action adventure games!: This is a pretty good game for GBA. I have played FFT for Playstation. I guess its a little better. At first when I got this game, I was thinking, "I wonder, is this game like FFT?". And I figured out later, NOPE!!If you want differences, continue reading!! Lets see, theres aggraviting laws that you have to follow(or you go to JAIL!!!!), you dont get abilities by gaining JP, you get them by certain armory and weapons, theres missions, clan wars, new races, some new jobs, you can lose units less often, and more I think. Im still on my way to beating the game, but along the Its been a pretty good game. There are better games probably, but if none of them are available, BUY IT!!!!!!! ITS GOOD!!!
__label__1 A very diasppointed book!!!!!: At the moment I first received this book, I was already felt disappointed as the book is a tiny one with fewer than 200 pages. I predicted that this book would not give much information on Newton, undisputably the greatest scientist and mathematician of all time!! ( Don't compare Einstein with him , the later can only be described as the greatest theoretical physicist of the 20 th century!) Considering Newton's achievement and his complicated life, a book ten times the content of this one even may not be enough!After reading the whole book, I was even more disappointed!! As the description of Newton's life is even less than any book on History of Mathematics!! Coupled with the expensiveness of this book. ( It cost me more than 60 dollars ) I cannot think of one reason to buy this book. I recommend " the life of Issac Newton or for a more detailed account, " Never at rest," both by Richard Westfall.
__label__1 Don't See THIS ONE if you liked the other two!: ANNE VS ESPIONAGE??! What a dumb plot. The music,setting, and portrayals of the characters that beckond you to want to live in Green Gables, are not only not present in this -- its almost like they burn up your love for them, and they actually burn up part of Green Gables. The end is strange and not very cohessive with the rest of the movie. They are very antiamerican, which didn't happen! I think it was too much plot in too little time. With such a sense of rushing through a wierd story, you never quite feel like you know what is going on. Follows looks like Hillary.
__label__1 Get out the ear plugs - THIS THING IS LOUD!: Makes great tasting coffe but the grinder sounds like a jet plane. Can't make coffee if anyone is sleeping... pretty inconvenient.
__label__2 Suffer the Little Children: This man was not human! To beat a baby into convulsions is just sick. What I don't get is the women were so nieve to him and believed everything he said. Now look where they are. In prision for life. He should be put to death for all he has done and the lives he ruined. People like him make me sick and I hope each and every monster in this world pays for their in humanity.
__label__2 Great book for truth seekers: This is a fair scientific review of the history of Islam. Although the language is difficult for people whose mother tongue is not English, yet it deserves all the effort I did to finish it.Thank you Mrs Armstrong. This book should be read by all Muslims & nonMuslims alike.
__label__2 Does just what it is supposed to.: Lightweight, easy installation. The only challenge is that the stencil for mounting the drawer is so large it doesn't attach easily under a desk, and has to be modified.
__label__1 I haven't drunk the Kool-Aid...: ...Meaning, I am not enamored of this book. It was overlong, silly, poorly written, repetitive, it had cardboard characters, and was nothing but a soap opera which happened to be set in early 20th-century Japan. To top it off, the sex scenes were gruesome and boring.I was hoping this book was better than the movie (which I saw first), but it wasn't. Also, why glorify the lives of women who were basically just high-priced prostitutes, who sold their virginity and selves to the highest bidder?Real Japanese culture could never be as dull as this book.
__label__1 Boring, prepetual words take reader on a superficial ride: While the novel has its moments, it surely was not what gave Lawrence Block his big name. The plot is very "on the surface" and quick, possibly too quick. More could have been done with character development, and a more played out resolution could have been made. The detective Scudder could have had more dimensions to his personality, and more could have been added about the details of his "relationship" with his ex-wife and also more on how his hardened personality came to be. Hopefully, some of his later Scudder novels were written better.
__label__2 Attack of the Chimera PDA: Wow, what a device. I was impressed with this PDA on steriods from the moment I pulled it out of the box. Normally I am dissapointed when I purchase a new gadget. It either doesn't work as advertised or it is so convoluted that I excile it to the land of misfit toys. This PDA though comes through on all of its promised features. With a respectable digital photo, video and audio capability combined with 802.11 wireless, bluetooth, Infra Red as well as USB data interface capability, what more could a PDA require. To be fair and balanced, The UX-50 does have a few issues that detract from its status as PDA nirvana. One is its fragility. I feel like I am holding a delicate piece of bone china everytime I use it. Additionally, I am very dissapointed in Sony and their decision to get out of the PDA business, and just when they seemed to get it.
__label__2 Great Book!: This a a good begginers only guide covering many topics in the field of Witchcraft. Tells about famous wizards and secret societies and helps you on your way to mastery of the Art. A great glossary at the end is a big help. I recommend it.
__label__1 Not to my taste: Although the service was prompt, this is not the tea I was expecting. This tea is bitter with a burnt taste and may appeal to some, but not to me. I feel this was a waste of my money. The packing looks idential to what I got from another vendor, but that had the packets in individual boxes and was a lovely milk tea.
__label__2 Greatest horror/fantasty writer of all time!: I own this DVD and watch it at least 3-4 times a year. I will have to watch it again soon, because I was sure there were three boys and a girl that were going out trick-or-treating.I loved the book and now love the movie, and Leonard Nimoy makes the movie even more special. There is more here than meets the eye as friends look into themselves to see their relations with the mystical Pip. We see what makes a leader great with empathy and forgiveness and a special warmth that encourages others to be empathetic and giving too.
__label__1 Good Singing And Playing?: Here Grand Funk do neither, but one can only expect so much from a second string hard rock band of the seventies, Boston, they ain't. Needless to say, this is the most inaptly named album of all time. The band, which is neither Grand nor Funky, is likewise ineptly described.
__label__1 Terrible Purchase *Wouldn't buy again: I bought this iron after many years using a Rowenta, but needed to transition due to finance. I have realized that it was a terrible financial mistake. I need to always buy quality products like the Rowenta. This iron leaked in just a few days. Does not heat up the best (compared to others).
__label__2 Great but please take note!: Great sounding speakers, they look good too and they were delivered nice and fast.I really am happy - to the point where I purchased some more for inside the boat :)The only thing I would like to point out is that after having them fitted in my cockpit for a while I noticed that the screws had started to rust - slightly disappointed that they werent stainless considering the main use of these as marine speakers.Still, a quick trip to the hardware store and less than 2 dollars later I had 8 stainless steel screwsSo, buy them for sure but change the screws out with stainless :)
__label__1 "Featurette" not worth it: This review pertains to this DVD, and not the movie itself. I LOVE this movie, and already have a copy on DVD. When I saw that it was being re-released with a featurette, I was anxious to buy it for the extra footage. The "featurette" is about 7 minutes long and is just a glorified trailer. It contains lots of movie clips and some interview material. The interview material focuses mostly on plot related topics and themes, and offers no insight into the making of the film or the beautiful location in Italy where it was shot. If you do not own this movie and are looking to buy it on DVD, I would recommend it. However, if you already own a copy of this movie on DVD and were thinking of buying this version for the featurette, don't waste your money.
__label__2 astounding debut ep from nyc power popsters: This has to be one of the best releases this year! This is defiantly a band to watch for! i saw them in los angeles they were just flowing with electricity!
__label__2 Excellent Series on the Origins of Mankind: The BBC's "Walking With Cavemen" is a fantastic documentary series that recreates the evolutionary adventure that was the journey from our earliest hominid ancestors to modern humans of today. Using the latest research in the fields of antropology and evolutionary science, the series highlights several key steps along the way from the diminuative ape-like Australopithecus afarensis to, ultimately, Homo Sapiens Sapiens, showing the various stages of physical as well as intellectual advancements. The effects and makeup are well done and help to create an interesting and believable world where our earliest human relatives lived, hunted, fought, and died.I was very pleased with this series and would highly recommend it and the other "Walking With..." films to anyone interested in ancient life and anyone who wants to get a fascinating glimpse of what life might have been like for our ancestors over the course of 3 million years.
__label__2 Improved Outlook 2007: Improved look and feel. Much easier to set-up email accounts. Easier to organize and manage high volume of messages.
__label__1 Minimally helpful: All information in these lectures can be found in other sources (Brunson's Super System, Caro's Book of Tells, etc.) in much, much greater detail. Of the hours and hours of information on this DVD, I found maybe 5% of it useful. For the price they're charging... that's not very good pot odds.
__label__2 my fav wwii movie: the movie speaks for it self, it is a great plot, charaters, actors , oddball my fav, what is taking you so long to oder this but now!
__label__2 Very informative and illustrated well.: A lot of detailed information, including actual photos of surgery techniques. Personal statements from FTM's were very helpful and good reading + information.
__label__1 Wow: ....And I thought Down was bad, do not buy this album expecting Pantera. Maybe i expect too much from the leader of the best metal band ever but this album is pure garbage, I threw it out the window of my car after listening to the first 4 songs
__label__1 150 pages too long - really just 3 or 4 good short articles: The book is 314 pages, about 150 pages too long. There's 3 or 4 article length stories here. The book is a Frankenstein, with two disparate themes#1) the evolution of the left tackle in professional football#2) Pygmalion Redux - an African American's journey from poverty to prominence.Theme #1 is football clinical - I enjoyed it, but the average reader might start to snooze.Theme #2 is heartwarming - but there's very little meat on the bone. Michael Oher won't open up to anyone, so the author is forced to present Michael's story from everyone else's viewpoint.All the participants are wonderfully likeable - no one appears to have any warts.The book - it's not quite a "Paper Lion" and it's certainly not an "Angela's Ashes".For comtemporary sports journalism, I would choose Gary Smith's "Going Deep".
__label__1 garbage: don't waste your money on this web cam, spend an extra ten to twenty buck more and get yourself a good camera for the PC. forget buying this peice of junk.
__label__2 Robin Williams beyond funny!: Robin Williams plays a robot who aspires to be a humanoid and meets a robotics engineer who designs prosetics and parts of human body parts to make him look that way. As he goes on, he learns and learns about human living and wants to be recognized as a citizen. He meets a woman, who is a regular human but she doesn't see it in him until later. When he ages, and she does too, he misses out on the show that recognizes him as a citizen because he dies, she decides to die next to him by having her life support system turned off. It has it's happy moments, and it's sad moments. I would recommend buying this.
__label__1 Leaks: After less than a year, this thing started leaking and the flow became restricted. There's no way to service this yourself, so we threw it out. Forget these units.
__label__1 queen of the gossip and ill match-making witch: a quite boring movie with shallow heroine character, a snobbish, phony, self-important, self-righteous, self-centered female egoist. the novel is also as boring as the movie itself. like gossip? watch the daytime soap operas, hard copy, access to hollywood....
__label__1 Meh: Not real impressed, movie is dark (like in, needs to be seen in the theater) we have a 72" TV and had all the lights out but the movie just was too dark and not a really well thought out story.Graphics are pretty good, the ones that can be seen
__label__2 The Best: This was an awesome album and I listen to it 24/7. The album has all of her best songs plus more. The choice of songs was good and it would have been better if it had more songs or even was a double cd set. The first single released, "That's the Way It Is", is an excellent song with a catchy tune that sticks with you.
__label__2 Do You Have The Need For Speed?: Need For Speed: Underground is one of the best installments in the series. Underground features extensive levels, character models, and of course, cars to get you into the game. After five minutes of playing you will be in awe. With car customizing this game is like a fantasy "The Fast And The Furious". You have to use your driving skills to win the races and tournaments and new modes including "Drag" and Japanese "Drift", to make your way to the top in this game. The only thing that would make this better is extensive levels where you can travel as you wish like in NFS: Hot Pursuit 2.
__label__1 A Total Waste of Money: This sleaze-fest would be hilarious, if it wasn't so sad. I think the only thing sadder is some of these reviews, wherein right-wing conservatives are worried that Hillary is going to usher in an era of Communism, Socialism, and every other scourge known to mankind. Oh, please! This book is just a hatchet-job, pure and simple. Nothing could be more obvious. Don't buy it with any illusions of quality. I'm sorry I bought it at all.
__label__1 Not for beginners: This video was hard to follow because they do not explain all of the dance moves. Ashly and Kym were ok as instructors. Maksim was stiff as a board.
__label__1 size is wrong: The overall design is good but the sizes make them unusable.I purchased both medium and large since my hand falls between the two, in both cases there is far too much extra space around the fingers and the palm is too small.After spending 2+ hours I managed to resize the large to almost fit me, the palm is still the size of a normal medium.This product is intended for people with sausages for fingers and tiny palms.
__label__1 Plot was lame. Started OK but no other redeeming features.: As other reviewers describe, the language is not period (or British) and the plot is horrid. Anachronisms all over the place, especially in the newly introduced characters. The American characters and the Black Magic themes do not work at all.I agree with the reviewers who found the beginning of the book mildly intriguing, with a nice relationship between Darcy and Elizabeth. The book goes downhill from the point when the Darcys discover the newly married Caroline (Bingley) walking in the gutter in the middle of the night.The characterizations of the original P&P; characters are good, the settings and wit are mostly acceptable, but none are excellent or inspiring enough to even begin to overcome the plot deficiencies.This one a loser. I edited my review and gave "Pride and Prescience" a second star after reading an even worse P&P; sequal, "Desire and Duty". At least "Pride and Prescience" had a mildly interesting beginning.
__label__1 Doesn't work with itouch: no wonder it was only [...] bucks, now that I look closer I see the ipod touch isn't supported, but wtf, it says it "works will all 'docking ipods'"I have an ipod touch, it docks, but apparently that's not a "docking ipod."Total waste of money! =/
__label__2 Made me a believer!: As someone who never really liked Britney Spears, when a friend of mine played her new CD for me, I was intrigued. I went out and bought In the Zone and I must say, it's just plain good music. I love the entire vibe of this CD and Spears' choice of several different but equally wonderful producers makes this album stand above many others. As someone who couldn't stand the girl, I can now say that I am a fan and I will be looking forward to future projects from her. She has really grown and this record shows that.
__label__1 Have seen it. Not impressed.: I have seen this thing and it is merely a smear job. Of course, modern political documentaries ARE smear jobs, in general. Michael Moore is the master, and this would have been a lot better if someone of his caliber had made it. His FAHRENHEIT 911 had its own little tricks, such as taking things out of context and editing footage. This one does the same. In general, I rely on my own research and gut feelings when it comes to casting my vote. Everyone else should do the same. Hack jobs like this are not useful information, whether liberal or conservative slanted.
__label__2 *_ENIGMA: Yet another journey from the enigma himself. Like every album, this one is unique and has a mind of it's own with of course the enigmatic flair. I can vividly imagine the celestial images when hearing it, and loving the layered and airy feel I constantly have it on replay. My favorite songs are; Eppur Si Muove, Feel Me Heaven, Dancing With Mephisto, Invisible Love, 20,000 Miles Over the Sea, Sitting on the Moon & Goodbye Milky Way. I gave this album 5 stars because of this man's incredible talent! He deserves it. Enigma has been my favorite since they started, because he gave me something to believe in.
__label__2 Fun, Fun, Fun!: Worm's Armageddon is one of the best, most fun games I've played even though it has simple graphics the fun factor is amazing. You wouldn't belive how satisfying it is blowing up little worms with weapons such as guided missiles, sheep, and you can even order in an air strike! This game is a definate buy for the holidays.
__label__2 From the Board Games Editor at BellaOnline.com: If you like Balderdash and you like the Scene It games, you're going to love this game. It's fun, funny, highly interactive and a total blast. Players are shown a clip on DVD, and they must describe what exactly is happening. I am at a complete loss as to where they got some of these clips, but they are hilarious.My one complaint about this game (and the entire line of Scene It games) is that they sort of defeat the idea of turning off the television and playing a board game, but for any household who thinks they watch too much TV, at least this is a step away from trashy primetime shows, and for families who don't watch much TV at all, you have nothing to worry about. In any case, the game is fun, unique and well thought out.
__label__2 Exciting experiential inner work.: Jeremy Taylor invites us to look inside of ourselves for healing. He takes us on a powerful journey into the dreaming mind and gives us tools to try and make sense of the often confusing signs and symbols we find there. The author is respectful in understanding that a dream is a singularly personal experience, and so does not try to fit dreams into a mold. He offers keys and clues to unlocking the mystery within. His guidelines for group dream work are grounded in respect and trust for individual members of the group, for the healing nature of the work, and for the very act of exploring the subconscious.
__label__2 Lots of people that don't understand this product: I read this reveiw section, and I see lots of folks that:1) don't understand the resolution and aspect differences between SVGA, MPEG2 (DVD), VHS and broadcast TV2) don't understand Microsoft operating systems (doesn't work after UPGRADING 98 to Win2k? What a surprise!)This is a great product. Works on both my XP Pro and Win2K machines, and looks great on my TV (which I have hooked up to it).
__label__2 Nothing better for backups: Pure and simple: Retrospect just works. Yes, it's a little confusing to initially set up, but once you've got it configured, I don't know of any better solution for backing up local or remote machines, be they Windows, Mac, or Linux, to any kind of backup media you can imagine: hard drive arrays, tape drives, optical discs, etc. Great product.
__label__2 beachwood sparks: this is a great cd. sounds like the birds meet pink floyd. also very relaxing which is needed in this crazy world
__label__1 This isn't even close.: I have loved this fragrance for years, it's not even close to the right sent. It must be a knock off. Don't waste your money.
__label__1 Yu-Gi-Oh just doesn't cut it: This isn't specifically this DVD, but the Yu-Gi-Oh series in general. It's not as much a "great anime" as something more like Pokemon, something younger children can identify with easier, not that there aren't older fans. Still, the entire concept of this series is old: "Believe in yourself". The whole series is based off this, and in every episode there's usually some "random chance" in which the character has a flashback of all his friends, and then miraculously draws the winning card. Sure, more and more "powerful" cards appear, but nothing really changes. Find a better anime.
__label__1 (La Crosse Tech.WS-9013UWorks only for two days.: Hi, When we bought it is worked fine. Then one day it stopped working so we replaced the batteries and it began to send the temperature readings to the receiver. After 2 days it stopped working. We replaced the batteries with brand new ones and it began to work for one day. Then it would occasionally work for one day or lass. It was beyond the return date When I took it from the drawer I put it in.. So I am just writing this review to warn people from buying this device. When it was working it was exactly what I needed. I will not recommend this item to anyone.J.GellerWC, CaliforniaLa Crosse Technology WS-9013U-CBP Wireless Temperature Station
__label__1 Did NOT work at all: After searching a lot on the internet, I decided to bauy this stupid Bird Repeller. It arrived in time, everything was perfect BUT: Pigeons do not seem to feel at all any sound, they simple stay there and dont care about this Repeller. Worse buying I ve ever made.
__label__1 Do not buy this router!: I have had nothing but problems with this router. It locks up constantly and needs to be powered off and back on regularly. During a firmware upgrade it locked up and I had to return it for a new one. I've lived with it for over a year now and it has quit working all together. Linksys does not have an 800 number for support and they do not respond to e-mails. Get a NetGear instead. When the Linksys died I replaced it with a rt314 which works flawlessly.
__label__1 Not worth the money: The player started making vibrating sounds less than 2 weeks after we bought it. The problems that followed included freezing, not recognising that it had a disk, and then finally not working at all. All of this took four months. The only good thing is that I will get my money back to buy another brand.
__label__2 images quality: the quality of images was almost perfect. i didnt like the central camera, it has a "double image" problem. I'd like to recommend this blu-ray to anyone who like great music
__label__2 Great product: This camera is designed for photographers of all levels, from a simple point and shoot to a complicated moving object and with just one button upload to the internet you will be on your way to greatness.
__label__1 Wanna Be Dizzy and Frustrated??: This is awful and not for a first timer. You rarely see the instuctor's feet, they do not explain the moves and the camera rotates around three ladies constantly. The background is white,the ladies are dressed in white, the camera is spinning around them. YUK!
__label__2 Best I could find...: I have a white Apple MacBook purchased Jan 2009. I tried a different keyboard skin and had to send it back, but this one fits very well and you can close the laptop with no problems. The grip is good and it is pretty easy to type, which can be a problem with some of the skins. It is made very well and seems durable and like it will last a long time. I like it a lot and it was the best one I could find, but there are a few annoying things. These issues may apply to all skins , not just this brand. I don't know because this is the first one I have ever used. The material used attracts hair and dust and it can be a bit hard to clean. You can't dry it because cloth and paper towel stuff will stick, so you have to be careful to keep the inside clean and free of dust/stuff so it does not end up in the keyboard when you re-apply the skin. I rigged up a chip clip and I hang it to air dry. I recommend this product, but keep these things in mind. Enjoy :)
__label__1 Acoustic Research AW-811 review: The speaker was purchased for use on a deck. The speaker worked fine and had good sound. For a single speaker receiving its signal from my A/V receiver, I was completely satisfied. However the speaker only worked for about an hour and then went completly silent. The transmitter was working but the speaker did not respond. From past reviews, this was not an uncommon problem.
__label__1 1 Star because you can't go lower than that!: The only thing this juicer is good for is to find out if you will really be into juicing. This juicer lasted for 3 months while juicing 3 to 5 times a week (for two people). At 3 months the tray that holds the blade warped and started spitting plastic into the drink. I considered getting another one to have spare parts....then I scraped that idea and got a real juicer. Besides being cheaply made...it should also be priced cheaper. Also the blade takes a while to clean.
__label__1 Baby Mozart: I would recommend spending money on a toy and playing some Mozart or other classical music for your child instead of purchasing this DVD. I heard so many good things about the Baby Einstein series that I bought the Mozart and Bach. I was very dissapointed, especially with the Mozart. I thought the video was not well done or very stimulating. I guess I expected a more polished or professional look. The Bach is better, however it appears the creators couldn't resist putting their children in the video. I found that a bit much.
__label__2 Great Game, But Hard Space Battles!: This is a great game, but the complaint I have are the space battles. Why can't be like the original Battlefront where there is no boost or those hard to destroy turrets! Or the fighters can be faster without the boost, so overall its just fast, but can make it slow! Rise of the Empire is a little hard. I'm on the Polis Massa level, but I almost beat the level(I only had one more Objective left!)Then my reinforcement force count depleted! I wish instead of restarting the level, you can restart teh objective. I heard that the Jedi can block rifle fire but I can't find the block button! Where is it! Can the next reviewer tell me!
__label__2 At the top of his form!: GS and BJ were a awsome duo.You don't have to agree with the politics in order to enjoy it. He is an powerful musical poet who recorded a string of jamming albums that moved your soul as well as your feet. GS is a balladeer of moving emotions just listen to "Winter in America". One only hopes that he can shake his demons and return to form! Buy It!
__label__1 Disappointing Recipes: I bought this book in high hopes of stocking the freezer with healthy recipes. I found the recipes in this book to be disapointing and fatty. The dishes that are to be frozen are dishes that don't take that much time to cook anyway. Therefore, by thawing and heating them you are not saving much time. I also did the 2 week meal plan and found that it took far more time that 1 1/2 days to prepare. I think that it is harder to prepare these meals in a day and a half than it would be to do them nightly.I would have prefered a book that had healthier and more creative recipes. I usually love to cook and was trying to do something that would make my life easier when my newborn arrives in a few months. This cookbook did not live up to what I expected. Sorry for the bad review.
__label__2 Good product, reasonable price: It's a camera battery - not much else to say. It does it's job, and I haven't had any explode on me yet, which is always a plus.
__label__2 memories: this one of those movie that reminds me of why i fled the pine curtain(east texas) a very funny movie ---j duvall austin tx
__label__1 Again and Again? More like please no more: Dull book. I read the whole book with the hopes that it would get better at the end. It didn't.
__label__2 TIGHT: I am not a kid. I just did not buy the album from amamzon. Lil Boosie is the realest rapper out now. While you other rappers are rapping and rhyming about nothing, Boosie tells life storys.His music is the best out the south right now. He makes crowd pleasing music. Boosie and Webbie goes the hardest out the south.
__label__2 Simply... good!: I hesitated too much before I wrote these words for those who are interested to read a review from a buyer of the Live at the greek". Why? Because it is to easy to judge...anything. For those who criticized the concert in such a manner that left no room for turning, think twice before you do this, because you can lack somebody the joy of watching his/her favorite singer. Lucky of me, I didn't read these notes before I buy the dvd. Otherwise, I woudn't known the emotion and happiness that produce me the contact" with live Closer tour. Nasal voice don't overcome the good performances that Josh Groban proved once again live in this tour. So, I can say only this, I enjoy very much every second when I'm watching Live at the greek".
__label__1 Dead Paradise: I bought it and was extremely disapointed. I think that I got the shaft. It was represented as a new novel. Instead, it was 2 old novels combined into one book.Buyer beware, I think that this is a case of gross advertising deception.
__label__1 thin a paper: The towel is very thin and not very good quality. I was very disappointed with this purchase it was a gift for my son. Picture online looks great product sucks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
__label__1 Dreamcast is DEAD!!!!: Come on, man. I agree with you that dreamcast's games are a lot of fun BUT it is hard to find the games to play. Last 6 months, I still can buy the dreamcast game (NBA2K2) but now you CANNOT get any dreamcast games or systems.Sega no longer make any games for dreamcast.No new games in DC and it is dead! Don't waste your money with it.
__label__1 From bad to worse: I wrote a negative review on 8/25/11 after getting this bag which did not have the normal strap on the back for shaking out clippings. Humboldt replied the same day that they would send me a bag WITH the necessary strap. That was two weeks ago and nothing from them. Stay away from these people. I would return the bag but I'm afraid I won't get my money back according to my experince so far. There are plenty of other suppliers who have to be more professional and honest. From now on this company will be called the Bah Humbug Sometimes Manufacturing gang.
__label__2 Best Dance Remix CD from the 80's: Pete Burns and company gave us some of the most innovative and heavy dance music...with his glam/genderbender image and free use of sexuality, Pete burns and Dear or Alive gave us dance music which was heavy with a dash of goth to it....RIP IT UP gives us the best of the band with the cd compiling some of the greatest tracks from the YouthQuake and Mad, Bad and Dangerous To Know CDs. IT contains the very cool (yet overplayed) You spin me Round, the Sexy Hooked On Love, the Gothic Something In My House and other gems such as Lover Come Back to Me and In too Deep....All put together in a never stopping 47 minute mix of hot sexy, heavy 80's Dance. If you want some of the best the 80's offered in British Dance, this album is the one to get!!
__label__1 Spend a little more and get a better shot!: The pictures that come from this camera, are grainy and unpredictable. Sometimes, it takes 2 or 3 shots to capture one picture because for whatever reason, the picture will be blurred - even at the highest setting with great lighting. I have been using digital cameras for the past few years and this one is the worst I've ever seen. I bought it for the extra memory card, and cradle but the camera isn't worth it. While the software and camera is easy to use, I find it more frustrating to take a quality picture. I frequently find myself reaching for my old trusty Olympus to ensure that I get the shot right. If I had to do it over again, I'd spend another $150 and buy another Olympus. This camera is more frustrating than it's worth!
__label__2 Surprised by movie: Although I bought this movie only to get a better glimpse of Alicia Coppola (who's career is hard to follow today), I was surprised by the quality of the movie. The action scenes were good, the dialogue wasn't cheezy overdone sci-fi blabber, the effects were terrific, and the overall production was good. If you like sci-fi, check it out! Or check out ufofilm.com for more info on the movie and others!
__label__2 Lots of wow from a little package: I purchased these to install in a rehab vintage console tv/radio/phono unit. On their own the speakers didn't impress, but I knew from reading other reviews that they would need a bit of a baffle to shine. I recessed the mounting of the pair and left the back exposed inside the cavernous console unit. WOW. The bass is overwhelming. There is no difference between this unit now and our home theater that has Polk tower speakers. Love these speakers.
__label__2 A fun learning tool.: My 3 year old daughter received this calendar as a gift last year and has absolutely loved it.I am a Montessori teacher and childcare provider and have been told by parents of my students (all ages 3, 4 and 5) that they love doing the date/calendar every day at school, they try to do calendar time on pretend calendars at home.So this year's gift for my six little students will be the Melissa and Doug magnetic calendar, I know they will love it!
__label__2 Party Fountain: I recieved my fountain and was very impressed with the look of it. It functions well and is very pretty all lit up with the punch running through it. It is a "big" hit with the kids. However, I ordered the 3 gallon, my invoice said 3 gallon but when I recieved it it is only a 2.5 gallon with a maximum of 1.5 gallon in the fountain at a time. I was very disappointed in that. That is false advertising in my opinion. The whole point was to not to have to have someone standing pouring punch for people.
__label__2 Fantastic: I thank you for what I needed for a new project. And I want you to know that I was able to download the owners manual on the item I had requested for.
__label__1 I don't get it: So there's an evil dead girl in a well and she made a cheesy short film on a VHS tape? Hello??? Hasn't this girl heard of DVDs??? And she kills you by showing you her face? Oh please! Michael Jackson's face scares me more! This movie is not scary in the least. I kept waiting for something to make my heart skip a beat but that moment never came. And when I thought the movie was over it wasn't and when I thought there was something else coming it ended. This movie is terrible. There are way too many plot holes. And the DVD extras are a waste of time.
__label__2 Love it!: This is the absolute best album, EMINEM has ever done. Everybody should buy this because it is so awesome.
__label__1 Not Impressed: The fax machine is quick at printing out receiving faxes. However it is rather slow in faxing out documents. I feel I should have bought the Canon faxphone L80 which is 33.6khz versus the Panasonic at 14.4Khz.Also the pages often get jammed in the machine which is not something you want to see in a $200 fax machine.
__label__1 Dishonest, through and through: Many reviewers have taken issue with Coulter's use of "facts"; I use quotes because many of the "facts" she cites are proven falsehoods (the NYT not mentioning Dale Earnhardt's death on their front page, etc.). spinsanity.org, a media watchdog that critiques those on the right AND left, has a lengthy list of the "facts" Coulter uses to support the arguments in her books and how they are, in fact, FALSE. So caveat emptor -- for you Ann fans out there, that means "Buyer Beware" in Latin.
__label__2 Very nice vanity: After reading a previous review about the great quality of this item, I bought one. This vanity exceeded my expectations for quality. I was very impressed with how well it was packaged and how easy it was to assemble. It looks much more expensive than the price I paid for it. I am very happy with this purchase.
__label__1 Did not last one whole day: Addie our 5 year old pit bull mix had gotten one of these balls (identical size and color)as present about a year ago. she loved it and played with it everyday. It lasted her almosta year before she chewed thru and it had to be tossed out. I wanted her to have a new onesince it was her favorite toy. Took her about 4 hours to chew thru this one and it hadto be tossed out. In all honesty I waited too long to send complaint or ask for refund.So that is my fault for procrastination. but if you have a chewer this ball probablywont stand up well for unsupervised play.
__label__1 Pointless game, too simple and you will ask yourself why?: A pointless game with the most basic gameplay, two tops going at it until one stops spinning or is knocked out of the stadium. You do this throughout the whole game and gets really repetitive. Most of the special beast that your beyblade can have are carbon copies of the other ones and have almost the same animation every time you do the attack. This game is just a cash in to the toy line and you'll have more fun with the actual beyblade and friends to play with them then this game. Don't Buy!If you do buy it then have fun wasting your money.
__label__1 Do Not Waste Your $$$ on Bella Dancerella: My daughter is 4 yrs. old and received the tutu (sz. 4-6) and the VHS version of the Bella Dancerella Home Ballet Studio from an aunt for Christmas. She was so excited, until we tried on the tutu and it showed the whole front side of her chest and the tutu stuck straight up! Not only that, the VHS tape was completely distorted and you couldn't hear most of it or understand what the girl was saying. This is a horrible product and should be taken off the market!
__label__2 Life of Christ: I have learned so much from re-reading the life of Christ through this book. Things I had missed before, ideas, concepts.
__label__2 Washburn Classical Guitar: I wanted a reasonable priced classical guitar and this model fit the bill. Sure there are others with a higher price, but for the money, this one is fine. Washburn and their China affiliate ensures quality and the sound is very nice. If you are looking for a good entry level classical style guitar then this would be a fine choice.
__label__1 Never Received!!!: I Have never received my book and it has been a long time, still waiting. . . . . . .
__label__1 This "tome" of meat cookery not realistic for everyday cooks: Considering how hefty this volume is, I was hoping to find recipes to produce well-cooked, flavorful meats with nearly any cut of meat I had in my freezer, using everyday ingredients I would normally have on hand. Not necessarily so. This is more of a gourmet's cookbook for those with time to cook, access to big-city delis and a liking for fussy sauces. Example: Puebla-Style Tongue in Chipotle Chile Sauce; Cured Pork Loin Roasted with Parsnips in Maple-Vanilla Sauce; Caribbean Pork Braised with Limes and Oranges; Sauteed Filet Mignon with Corn and Chile Cheese Sauce. There is some basic information on how to best cook some cuts of meat, but not enough to justify the price of the book, and the recipes rely heavily on the fancy ingredients. As a side note, if you don't like to include alcohol in your cooking, this is not the book for you! The recipes and tips on cooking pork ribs were good.
__label__2 Great for work or a solid gift: Bought this for Grandpa after it came around many many times on my Pandora channel at work. Wonderful music to play at work - unobtrusive to the mental process.
__label__2 Good purchase: I brought it for my daughter who has braces she loves and says it works great I would recommend this to a friend
__label__1 library code: playing this games is very best and enjoy but i have problem to find the code at library ,
__label__2 Finally! Someone takes on the Mutual Fund Industry!: Finally! A book about SMART, SAVVY, EFFICIENT and COST-CONSCIOUS investing for not just the super-rich, but for the typical affluent investor!As an independent financial and wealth advisor to many affluent (but not Super-Rich) clients, I have ALWAYS advocated utilizing investment strategies other than Mutual Funds.Mutual Funds are very costly, very inefficient, and typically underperform the market by a long shot. But where's the typical investor to turn?With "Stop Wasting Your Wealth in Mutual Funds" Don Wilkinson has written a very Consumer-friendly and informative guidebook on how the average investor can set up portfolio management in Separately Managed Accounts and get on the road to achieving much more success with their money.Definitely an eye-opener to the pitfalls of Mutual Funds, and to the positives of Separately Managed Accounts.
__label__1 You Get What You Pay For: I though i got the best deal EVER when i was able to purchase this item at $ .01... Well After the first 2 uses, i realized just why it was practically given away! Too bad i lost out on the shipping costs....
__label__1 not worth it: The sound is horrible. Don't waste your money, even on the collectible tracks. They're taken from vinyl and digitized badly.
__label__1 This movie was pathetic.: Sorry, but I had this movie figured out within ten minutes. Talk about formulaic. Friends told me the visual effects were "awesome" but I was hard pressed to find anything that hadn't been done better in any number of other sci-fi thrillers. Hard to believe Gary Sinise got involved with this one. I'm not surprised Madeline Stowe was involved...her career has been on a downslide for years. The costume design was weak, set design weary, dim, and gray for no reason, and supporting actors like the military characters were forced.
__label__1 Did not like: Did not like the book. It seems to clash with my christian belief. But at least it gave me an idea of what cabala is.
__label__1 did not last long at all: cheap connectors; cheap wire; don't expect it too last long; mine lasted a few months before it started to deteriorate (crack/separate) in a couple places due to flexing... I ended up buying the best... an equivelent version from Monster Cable here on Amazon
__label__1 Not worth the price: It's a great concept but not worth the money. Some of the tasks don't go a long way toward teaching kids the skills the task is designed to teach. It looks like it was designed in a hurry, without much thought or testing and should be marketed for considerably less money.
__label__2 A good game.: This game is good. It's challenging but it's good and is a lot of fun. There are two views. The first level is the top view and then the second is the side scroller. A fun game you're able to get plenty of powerups and firepower. This game isn't bad at all
__label__1 No alerts: Works great as an alarm clock or am/fm radio, but never sounds alert. Reception of weather broadcasts are clear when Weather/Hazard button is pushed. Alert is on continuously. The advisory, watch, and warning lights have never lit. No alerts when using the Quick Start set-up, All, or manually programming SAME codes. Would not allow me to enable the alert for the weekly test, so it was impossible to know if the darn thing was working. Bought this because I had a Midland for years which worked great, but this one is a dud.
__label__2 The Years Best Film: In my humble oppinion this film is the best of the bunch this year. I also loved private ryan, but this is a more elequent, complex movie that is not for all tastes. In my oppinion, it is a work of genius. I was enthrawled with it all the way through. And like L.A. Confidential from last year, it is a shame that the thin red line didn't get the respect that it deserved. A terrific achievment!!!
__label__2 Good price: Saw the complete series at amazon, a little expensive but could not pass up the complete series. Better than buying each season separately.
__label__2 Nice strong coffee: It is nice strong coffee. I learned of it in Costa Rica. It is whole bean, and I grind it up every day. It is good stuff !!!
__label__1 Waste of Money: My children were not able to wear this costume for Halloween. The costume said that it was for sizes 0-6 months. However, the costumes were gigantic! There is no way that any baby who is under 6 months old would fit into this costume. It looked like it was sized for a toddler. This ended up being a huge waste of money since I had to get other Halloween costumes for my children to wear.
__label__1 A little lacking: I bought this book while in the brainstorming phase of my outdoor kitchen. Incidentally it's STILL in that phase, and this book did not advance my cause at all. It had good reviews and I was hoping it would have good ideas and planning tools. Instead, it seems to focus on only a handful of actual kitchens, and doesn't really cover much ground. It does not have any recommendations on building YOUR kitchen as far as usage of space, appliance placement, etc. There is ZERO cost information as well, so if you are hoping for help shaping your kitchen budget, this also is not the tool. It has some moderately useful technical information, but not nearly enough to let you build anything unless you already knew how, in which case...you wouldn't need the book. Basically, it's got some nice pictures of some pretty sweet kitchens that might give you an idea here and there; that's about it.
__label__2 Thought Provoking: Finally, a group of artists who have substance both lyrically and muscially. This type of integration is few and far between among most of the current day artists. I like all the songs but specifically Warning Signs and Green Eyes. Excellent mood music. Get it.
__label__2 An excellent resource for Christian apologists: Cults have attacked various orthodox Christian doctrines for centuries mainly via misinterpretation of various Scripture. But over those centuries the attacks became very repetetive in nature and methodology to a point where Christian apologists had plenty of refutation made available. There are several Christian resources that address this and this book by Rhodes and Geisler (two well-known and acknowledged Christian apologists and scholars) is among the best IMHO. This is very beneficial for not only clergy but laity as well.
__label__2 Great booster seat: Great booster seat. Easy to install. So far working out great. Took FOREVER to get it though - shipment was almost 2 weeks later than estimated.
__label__1 I recommend against this hard drive: The drive was accidentally disconnected without ejecting it first. My foot hit the plug and the plug pulled out of the socket. The drive is no longer recognized on my iMac with OS 10.4.5. Lacie support said that was the way things were with firewire drives and blamed the situation on the MAC OS. They said all the other manufacturers would have the same problem. I don't buy that logic. Sorry, guys. I can't recommend the purchase of your products.
__label__1 very unhappy: I was ever disapointed with this book. I didn't read the reviews for book 4 because I had enjoyed the other 3 so much.But this book was divied into two books which I would have liked to know before I got to the end of the book. Goes to show the writter was after the money not the reader. I have not bought book five for that reason.
__label__2 This is Very Good Stuff!: The Orange Power Holding Tank Chemical works great! It's the best I have used in the last 12 years.
__label__2 Classic 80's metal!: The classic 80's metal album re-mastered, not a horrible re-master like some discs I have heard. Makes it sound even better than the original. Vinnie Vincent at his best in my opinion...all of the guitar tracks are raw, no effects whatsoever.
__label__1 NOT WHAT I THOUGHT IT WAS: when I ordered the book I didnt realize that it was a minature book. I thought I was ordering a full sized book. This book is about a 1.5" square, not very conducive to reading.
__label__1 opinion: Book was not of historical quaility. Was likely a work aimed at jr. high school students. It is a brief outline of his life with likely imagined conversations.I was aware this was a "copied" out of print book and the result was not too bad.
__label__2 Proud of your Heritage: I bought the Hi Tops for my daughter, who is 11 years old. She plays basketball and has always like the style of these shoes. However, once she saw that they came with the Puerto Rican flag, she wanted them right away. She was born in Miami however I was born and raised in Puerto Rico. I knew that she was proud of her heritage but with these shoes she confirmed it. It has been a little over a month and the shoes practically walk alone. She uses them every chance that she gets. They are comfortable and "cool" to wear....
__label__2 Don't workout without it.: It is not about just gaining muscle mass, Cellmass helps repair muscles preventing that '48 hour' later stiff and soreness. Bottom line using this as driected will get you back in the gym tomorrow and the next day ...
__label__1 Instruction manual missing pages and several parts missing: My two year old was so excited to get this bike! We noticed that the box had A LOT of packing tape on it, as though it had been opened previously. Once opened, we noticed that was not a "parts" section in the owners manual, then we noticed that several pages in the manual were repeated, then noticed that several pages were missing! The manual pages were as follows: 1, 2, 5, 6, 5, 6, 7,8,7,8, 11. There was no way we could put this together - and the pages that were present had parts shown that were not in the box!! We tried to call the company on the owner's manual, but they are only open M-F and we attempted to put this together on Saturday morning.... Pacific Cycle in Olney, IL. Only a message to call back M-F between 8-5. FRUSTRATING!! The bike seems like good quality, but getting it assembled is not possible. I will never order something like this again from Amazon.
__label__2 Really enjoyed this movie: It was a really nice movie that caught your attention and made you tap your feet along with the music. Even my husband enjoyed this movie and he's more of a action/adventure guy. In the beginning the movie seems somewhat disjointed but at it progresses it mostly comes together. Would recommnd this movie.
__label__1 IT Stinks: I had this card put in my hp that has windows xp and it stinks. I play everquest and it is blocky ,flickers and now I cannot even play it. I tried down loading new drivers and all that did was make me have to reboot. I totaLLY THINK THIS CARD IS A WASTE OF MONEY.
__label__1 Loud and Simplistic: First off, this toy is LOUD. I am not sure if other parents have noticed a disturbing trend in the loudness level of toys these days. This toy falls into this category. I have resorted to placing tape over the speaker holes to mute the loudness of the sound. I fear for my son's hearing.Second, my son quickly played out this toy in about 20 mins and know shows little interest in it. And at $25, that's not good.
__label__1 Not so great: Gifted half a dozen of them to my dad since he is a big fan of Brut, unfortunately he didnt like it so much. Says that the fragrance doesn't match the original Brut. Disappointed!!
__label__1 terrible beyond comprehension: sheila's singing style and the arrangements are straight out ta welk show. schmaltz with no redeeming quality...webb's 10 easy pieces or the reissued glen campbell 'reunion' cds show how it's 'sposed to be done....
__label__1 For obsessive completists only: The rest of their catalog ranges from good ("Crashing Dream") to godlike ("Emergency Third Rail Power Trip", "Explosions in the Glass Palace", "Beyond the Sunset"), but don't buy this one for musical reasons. I've got it, and if I lost it I'd have to replace it, but that's only because I'm an obsessive completist.
__label__2 Weird City Makes Good Reading: I picked this book up because the author wrote an interesting article on Angela Carter another web site. I was not disappointed.There are four short stories here, that when added together in this book, create the wild tale of this unbelievable city.If you like the likes of Angela Carter, Alasdair Grey, or Philip Pullman you will like Jeff Vandermeer.
__label__1 Great first song; otherwise disappointing: The first track of this album, "Jarhand", was an iTunes free download, and it is everything you could possibly want in an indie pop song: great, infectious melody, terrific arrangement, nice harmonies, upbeat, and lots of hooks.Sadly, for me, none of the other tracks are at all engaging. Somehow the songs remind me of the opera, "The Cunning Vixen", in which the words seem to be spoken more than sung and ultimately is a bit of a bore.On the plus side, I think the cover art is terrific.
__label__1 Boring: The author states in the beginning of the book that this is a collection of stories where she was trying to answer a question and it did not merit an entire novel. She should have kept these "answers" to herself. The stories are too short to even tell a good tale. There is no character development, everyone is one-dimensional. If you did not know V.I. Warshawski before reading this book, you wouldn't know her after this book either. All the stories totally lack the real V.I. and I can't pick a single one that was worth reading. If you are a die-hard fan of V.I. and must read this book, get it from the library.
__label__2 Funny Tragedy: I can't believe he made such a funny book about a heartbreaking subject. I am in shock that this even happened. If only I could have one more book from him. However, it is too damn late. I can not believe I am wanting to cry and laugh at the same time.
__label__2 Excellent Filler Paper ~ Hard To Find: I am very pleased with the quality of this filler paper. I've been using this size paper for my personal recipe book for many years, but recently it has been hard to find. I'm so glad that Amazon carries this product. TOPS provided excellent service as well.
__label__1 don't waste your money...: These wipers are real junk! I got them because of a mail-in rebate buy 1 get 1 free but even that way they don't cost their money at all. Very inconsistant, don't do the job at all even as a brand new. They leave the winshield blured and you'll be in trouble in a rainy days. I will never buy from this brand again and my advise to you is to do the same...
__label__2 Good read: A nice pick-me-up, but not as fun to read as "Illusions." Though it is short, it slows a little toward the middle, and not as distinguishable from other books of a similar theme. Worth looking at, but for inspirational reading by Bach, I'd go for "Illusions."
__label__2 Huckleberry Hound: I enjoyed the cartoons immensely, but, I must mention my dissappointment in the way it was put together. I loved seeing the beginning, and end segemts of the show, the commercials for Kellogs, and the re assembled show. However, I must admit to my dissappointment of having just a few segments of the bw show, and the rest, including ALL the cartons in color from the 60's. This is not truly the first season. Only parts are. I would like to see more original shows of this great cartoon classic. And, boy, did the music bring back great memories! If I may here, "....Get yourself all set, tune up your tv set for Huckleberry Hound. That oh, so merry, chuckleberry, Huckleberry Hound!.. Huckleberry Hound!" Please produce more of this great classic.
__label__2 El Capitan me ama!: El capitan (my penguin) is the best surrogate for my girlfriend while we are apart. He snuggles me, but in a very platonic way so that I don't get odd feelings. He entertains others while they are over, to great effect. He is always there for conversation and never gets overemotional or heated even in the most passionate of arguments. He always keeps a stiff upper beak when I leave him for long periods of time, and never reprimands me when I return, because he understands that sometimes I just need space, you know? He is everything I need him to be, and when times get tough, he makes a good pillow (to cry on and to lie on).[...]
__label__1 Loss for Words: Whew, this book left me confused and was returned to the library the next day. If you like to read about Freud and his ideas behind why we are Anorexic or Bulimic then you may like this. It also blames the mother for everything!
__label__1 Good premise but hard to follow: I have to admit, it took me two tries to finish this book. The first time I got bogged down in all the descriptions, cussing and cast. The second half was better than the first - once you make contact with the alien and feel its presence in the "zombies" it began to make more sense. It's not the worst book I've ever read, and I will definitely try at least one more book by this author, but I don't feel this is a good one to read first. (Also - is there anyone actually happy in this book? If there is, I didn't find them...)
__label__1 A Little Fun, A Lot of Stupid: Really a dumb book. I'd suggest it for airplanes or poolside holidays. Few redeeming elements, I'm sorry to say. It was well-written and light, but also very very obvious and silly. The kind of book where a running joke is women trying to guess how big a guy's thing is. Of course, the girl gets the guy and his thing is huge. Now isn't that the sweetest ending ever?
__label__1 Hurt my ears!: I tried these on for 5 minutes and my ears hurt!! The shape hurts! I tried at another time and it was worse. Returned.
__label__1 Not quite a rainbow connection: Oddly enough, this film has a very similar plot to 2011's "The Muppets," which came nine years later. The difference is that "The Muppets" is funny, and this film is not. Awkward humor, too many depressing moments, too many rude and embarrassing things that one wouldn't want one's kids to see.For Muppet holiday viewing, get the infinitely superior 1987 "Muppet Family Christmas" or 1992's "Muppet Christmas Carol."
__label__2 loved it: Tarr knowledge of horses and history shine in her fantasy. So far this author has not disappointed me.This book stand alone ,but "Lady of horses" "Daughter of Lir" (sequel) and "The Shepherd kings" enrich this book.
__label__2 spider sucker, sucks good: It is not the same as the last one I had, but works just as good if not better. They are a good omen, I don't want to kill them. Unless they scare the ____ out of me, then I might hurt them by de fault. Would buy another one here if I need one.
__label__2 This book is a godsent to the perplexed!: Finally a book that answers all those nagging questions I've been asking myself for years. It is a true eye opener into the workings of the abusive man, including the insidious verbal abusive who is so nice to the outside world that no one would possibly ever believe you if you complained. It is just so uplifting to know that someone does see through these behaviors and can also explain them so well that women can finally learn the inner workings of the chronic abuser and gain the courage she needs to protect herself.
__label__1 BABYZ NOT FOR WINDOWS XP: Just bought the game and can't get it to run in Windows XP!!! Have tried everything that tech support says and still no go. Sure glad I wasted the money. NOTHING said when I bought it that it wouldn't run in XP!!!!!!!!
__label__1 spend your money on another controller: does not turn the unit on and off- basically a redundant waste of space that offers nothing more than the controller has. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!
__label__2 Kingson Memory: They sent what I ordered. The only complaint is that it took 7 days to get with standard shipping.
__label__2 great smooth jazz assortment: The music is from many varied artists and could be considered acid jazz, but it is a great addition to your jazz collection.
__label__1 ANOTHER ANGRY FAN....: I was already waiting for this DVD to arrive when I read the other reviews. Otherwise I would have cancelled my order. This is a fine British sci-fi horror shocker that is well done in color and capably acted. It's one of my favorites. What this Allied Artists company has done with it is astonishingly awful....I'm just sick over their utter gall to release this neglected gem in such terrible condition. It's so faded and poorly reproduced that you can't even enjoy it....
__label__1 LAME: Don't buy this game. You can't save except at checkpoints, so when you are killed, you have to play through almost the whole thing again just to get back to where you were. Even a head shot with an M1 Garand does not drop the enemy, COME ON!!!! The enemy soldiers have superhuman reflexes and can duck as soon as you pull the trigger. This game is boring and you feel like you are fighting with a pea shooter for all damage you can do to your enemy. First person shooters need to find another war to fight, (Korea would be cool) We have won World War Two too many times now.
__label__1 cuisinart 600 ~ A waster of money, consumer of time: You want to spend HOURS disassembling and cleaning this machine! BUY IT!Want simplicity, and frustration free coffee making???But a separate bean grinder, and a PLUNGER (French Press).The coffee will be better, more enjoyable, and all you do is wash out the plunger.This Cuisinart machine ~ i wouldn't even give to a charity shop - SAlvation Army!!!!! It is in the garbage bin!
__label__1 Appears used: I love the Brita On Tap system and have been using it for years. My dismay is with the seller -- when the filters arrived they were just knocking around in a box without the packaging that comes with new ones. The product wasn't advertised as used.
__label__2 Christmas Music Review: I chose the highest rating for two reasons:1. I needed some new Christmas music that was modern and festive2. This was one of the best cd's I've ever heard. I love every song and sing along with all of them.I would recommend this to anyone needing to get into the Holiday spirit. As always, MercyMe keeps the real reason for this season evident in each song.
__label__2 A beautiful book, I can't stop looking at it...: I love this book! The photography and presentation are both breathtaking. The format is totally perfect. The recipes are certainly mouth-watering. But. There is no possible way you could attend your own cocktail party if you made some of these recipes! You'd never leave the kitchen, really. No matter, though, the recipes are great and this book is a marvelous place from which to get inspiration. I don't see why people get so sarcastic and down on it -- some of us just prefer to live more gracefully than others.
__label__1 TRAGEDY !: Schumacher, why did you give us, Batman fans, this terrible demonstration of film-making? Why one of the most charismatic comic characters of all times had to be destroyed in this brainless history ? he (Batman) was at least "surviving" in the other three pictures, maintaining some credibility ( isay some because comic characters always loose their real charisma when going to the big screen(. Sad picture. It's not Clooney's fault. It's pure bad screenplay.
__label__2 Superb from start to finish!: i cannot put into words how much i enjoy this cd. i purchased their first album " oh inverted world." and really liked them. but this beats that out a million times over. every song is a complete gem in its very own right. from the istantly catchy "turn a square" to the almost haunting "pink bullets" it grabs hold and won't let go until the last track ends and you hit replay. the only shortcoming i can see with this cd is that it leaves me longing for more than ten masterful tracks. a gorgeous piece of work. well done guys!! can't wait for the next run!
__label__2 Excellent wireless router: Great range, no disconnects, fast, everything you want in a wireless router. Works much better than the Belkin Pre-N that kept losing connections every few hours. The Trendnet router is not the prettiest router around, but performs great for this price range.
__label__2 GREAT FOR HEALTHY FISH: I HAVE A 240 GALLON FISH TANK THAT I HAVE HAD FOR OVER 20 YEARS. I HAVE FISH LIVE IN THIS TANK MUCH!!!! LONGER THAN ANYONE I KNOW. I HAVE HAD MY TANK UP AND RUNNING WHEN MY STERILIZERS WERE OUT OF COMMISSION AND I SEE A DRASTIC DIFFERENCE IN THE QUALITY OF THE WATER AND THE QUALITY OF THE FISH. I THINK THIS IS A BIT ON THE EXPENSIVE SIDE BUT A GOOD PRODUCT.
__label__1 Polaroid one 600 instant camera ultra: I purchased this camera because of the promise of great, portrait quality prints, sharp image, 2 foot focus, etc. and am soundly disappointed. The quality of the prints is TERRIBLE-- fuzzy, no detail, etc. (and I am not a perfectionist!!) It feels cheap, the paper is expensive-- which I could accept if the quality were slightly above average-- but I consider this a TOTAL waste of money.
__label__1 Too much sex!: Have read all the books published to date. Loved the plots and story lines. Finally through them all out (Yep, tossed one paperback and two hardcopy) as I realized as I was re-reading them, that the somewhat graphic sex (Dominance and Submission, and Harem Girls, etc) didn't really add to the story but sure promoted things I just don't like. The March Upcountry series with David Weber had boys and girls, and talked about sex, but was what I consider more normal for SciFi, and was not graphic, did not promote "alternative" sex. So while I enjoy the James Bond nature of the novels, I really can't recommend them to any of my friends, and wouldn't recommend them to anyone younger.
__label__1 Sent it back right away!: I ordered this item, I made a mistake! It didn't have a built in screen protector. It was hard to fit the Motorola Q in, which does not mean that it is good because it is a tight fit. It meant that the built in openings for the camera, charger etc... easily became partially covered b/c it didn't fit in well. Also, there is no covering for the top of your phone. IT was a completly worthless case for me.
__label__1 What a disappointment [but I'm an old guy]: The Colbert Report is required viewing in our house. Maybe it is telling that the only other Comedy Central show I watch is Jon Stewart.My wife loves Colbert- and my daughter [22yrs old] had caught part of the special and said it was super. So I ordered 3 copies- one for our house and 2 for gifts.My daughter still thinks it was funny. My wife and I were very disappointed. The language and content of the previews of other Comedy Central shows before the special nixxed any possibility of giving the CD's as gifts. The show itself wasn't R rated- but it was nowhere near as funny as Colbert's 1/2 hour regular show.
__label__2 Excellent book: I am very pleased with this book especially since it has great clip art that any teacher or person who likes to decorate anything would love and was a great buy.
__label__1 NOT a Win Craft product: Don't be fooled by the picture! This is not a Win Craft Sports Die Cast Decal. I gave it 2 stars because I probably would have kept it if the font style used was the same as the picture, but not even that is the same as whats advertised. I could have gone to the nearest mall to get one of these.
__label__2 GENESIS HISTORY, although not an "in concert" DVD: This is a very good historical overview of this great band (5 stars for this, 3 stars for not being an in concert DVD). It has great concert footage from different epochs and interviews (old and new) with practically all members of the band. It is great as a historical perspective, although if one is interested in Genesis "in concert", this is not it; songs are presented in short fragments. I really wish that a series of DVD's would be issued of Genesis in concert, because both the fans and the band deserve it. From this DVD it is quite clear that shortage of footage is not the issue. Finally, have you seen/heard Steve Hackett's DVD the Tokyo Tapes, a must!!!!!!!!!!
__label__2 FUN: its like 4.5 bc it wasnt perfect..which is hard. looove this book ok at first (i love the author and ive read the shopaholic series and can you keep a secret) so at first i was not as happy..it started off a bit slow but i got so into it. wow ok its really funny and theres parts where the lines are hilarious..all kinsellas characters are! great, fun book!
__label__2 Conway Twitty's 1982 TV Special: This DVD is of Conway's 1982 Mississippi river boat tv special. The sound quality is very nice, though parts of the 90 minute special were edited out like, Conway playing baseball with Barbara Mandrell, in fact her name is mentioned on the box, and Conway singing his latest hit at the time "We Did But Now You Don't" and there were some more songs sung, I remember, by Jerry Lee Lewis and Charlie Pride but this is a very nice DVD to have in any fan's collection.
__label__2 T-Fal Avante Toaster: Unfortunately, I did not read reviews until after I ordered this toaster and was contemplating having to return it based on the reviews I had just read. What a pleasant surprise to discover that it makes perfect evenly browned toast in all 4 slots and even better bagels. We've used the toaster for 2 weeks and, based on present performance, would not hesitate to purchase another--highly recommended--very good product and nice to look at as well!!
__label__1 Meh...: This product works fine if it fits the doorway perfectly. But be warned - If the space under your door is too wide it won't work at all and just hinders the opening and closing of the door. The materials are cheap as well, seems like I should have paid less for a scrap of fabric and 2 foam tubes.
__label__1 Plastic Bag Hanger: The arms are too short so that the bag isn't held open wide enough to drop trash in.
__label__1 WHAT A WASTE OF A GOOD IDEA: The premise of this book is excellant. Everything else is awful. I can't believe I wasted an entire afternoon reading it... I won't waste anytime repeating what other reviewers have already stated...I just wish that I could give the book 0 stars.
__label__1 Worst book I ever read: After forcing myself through 300+ pages, I had to let others know how boring this book was. If you're looking for action, combat, courage under fire, etc., this book's got about 30 pages of it. The rest is all about his everyday life, written in excruciatingly boring detail. He takes pages to describe the school bus schedule for his kids, his wife's interest in sewing clubs, and other boring household stuff like that. He spends more time describing his efforts at manipulating and getting around the system to keep his family on Okinawa then on military action. He doesn't describe SF training, openly complains about having to return for his tours in 'Nam, and complains about just about everything else. In comparison with other great books about combat, such as James Watson's "Point Man," this is a real dud. If the choice was available, I'd have rated it 0 stars.
__label__2 Noise canceling headphones deliver good sound with significant noise reduction: These headphones have exceeded my expectations. They offer satisfactory sound quality and significant noise cancellation for a reasonable price. I suspect that the Bose noise-canceling headphones would outperform this model, but I feel that I have received excellent value for the price that I paid. Besides, I attended too many rock concerts in the 70s to be able make fine distinctions in sound quality.I use my headphones at work to drown out conversations that are going on among my coworkers. These headphones allow me to achieve this goal at much lower volume levels than my ear-bud set.
__label__1 Way, Way, Way too long: The whole movie was really boring. It was two hours of boring stuff. Finally at the end there was a little action. It actually was kind of a funny movie. It should be under the comedy section.
__label__2 An outstanding attempt to understand human violence: In the course of reviewing over 20 books on the topic of human violence and mass murder, I found this to be far and away the best. Some obviously have problems with the author's attempts to understand and not just demonize killers. I can think of no other way of getting into the heads of those who commit violence in the name of a state, an ideology, an ethnic group, a religion or indeed any other belief system. Confronting the "banality of evil" is indeed an unpleasant exercise, but necessary if we are ever to achieve a deeper understanding of our greatest failing as a species. To summarize, this work is probably the best research-based study of the psychology of human mass violence currently on the market.
__label__2 Good and easy read: Clear sample interview questions with concise analysis on the variety of answers for each questions.Valuable info with an easy read.
__label__1 Poor Production - The Guys Sound Better Than This !: I haven't seen this in years, but remember the sound doesn't do them any justice. The video seemed ok, so I'd prolly give it a 3 for the video & a 1 for the audio...It's a pity really. Hopefully, if they re-release it on DVD, they can get the original multi-track reels & remix it, so it sounds more like the guys really did. The sound is very compressed, no dynamics, the guitars are thin & Michael's vocal sound isn't as strong as it could be...Prop's go out to the guys though for making the effort, as back in the day, it was a big deal & they do rock !To hear the band as they should sound, listen to Against The Law...
__label__1 1080i: ****BEWARE*** this release is the 1080i version.(hence the two star rating) if u dont care.. then buy away. Other than that, this a Great movie....
__label__1 This won Oscars?: This is little more than a filmed broadway show. When I go to Broadway I want to see a play/musical and when I see a movie I want to see a movie. Don't let the hype fool you, Zeta-Jones did not turn in an Oscar worthy performance and who chose Richard Gere? Gere is a great actor and a lousy singer. He was doing a bad Anthony Newly impersonation. Best Picture of the Year? This just opens the door for Hollywood to make more lame musicals.
__label__2 Not for everyone: This gorgeously writtenl mind-bender of a novel is not for people who are afraid to think. Read it and savor the delicate, bracing flavor of brainpops made of cognitive salami. Masticate crunchy kernels of nostalgia and sadness. Treat yourself by decoding this codex of mysterious time-loops and emotional wordplay. Dress yourself in bacon. Challenge yourself. Read it and weep.
__label__2 Love this curry!: My husband and I have been asking our New York friends for years to bring us boxes of S&B Medium Hot curry when they visit because we can't find it in Richmond. So glad to know we can get it on line. We love this curry, so easy to make. I usually add carrots and onions along with the chicken, and melt the blocks of curry paste in water in the microwave so it blends better. It's also excellent in a pie, just make the receipe and put it in a baked pie crust, cover it with another pie crust and stick it in the oven for a little while.
__label__2 Great product for the price!: Though it cost me less than $10, this pen has become my cleaning item of choice for several digital cameras and HD video cams. The ability to remove all dust, in both humid conditions where it would seem to not want to stick to the brush, and dry conditions when static electricity would seem to make it want to stick ot the lens, has been remarkable. The felt end also does a fantastic job on slight smudges that I'd normally have to use a wipe on. I'm very happy with this.
__label__2 Pachmyr Recoil Pad: Great recoil pad for the price. I like and have used the cross core recoil pads in the past for their cushioning effect and reduction in recoil. I have just ordered 2 more of these the same. Just a little bigger than my stocks, allowing me to finish to stock size.
__label__2 Son's Present: This item was purchased for my son and he has told me that he thinks it's an absolutely wonderful product. In fact, he plans to purchase another one. I guess that says a lot about it.
__label__1 National Book Award???: I thought this book was so thoroughly bad, I could not believe it won any award! It was boring, boring, boring. I did not enjoy the characters, from the mother who drowned puppies to the very unlikable and promiscuous bisexual character, Tony. It's pretentiousness and lack of passion truly made me want to throw it in the trash can. The only reason I finished it was because we had to read it for our reading group.
__label__1 Ordered one thing, received another: I ordered a Meridian 8009 by MERIDIAN... Received a Meridian 8009 by AASTRA!! That was not what I expected, and not according to their description.
__label__1 Poorly directed .. but hey .. its Overkill: If you're into Overkill, just go ahead and pick this up, because DD and Bobby are still churning out decent speed metal and more importantly many of their older, greater songs are here. What I dislike about this DVD is the sterility of the directing/footage. It is almost like the audience and band were shot on different sets, there is little "in your face" interaction. Of course, my separate shooting theory is BS, because thats NOT how it was shot, but the camera work is quite focused or claustrophobic - one shot lingering on one band member (or on the audience), with very few wide shots or shots from "within" the audience (see Emperor DVD for great shots from "within" the audience). Another problem that may just be my player, but the sound editing seems a little off - the song just ahead or behind the visual (very annoying .. anyone else notice this?). However, it is Overkill and they play a spot-on set, as usual.
__label__2 A cute movie for little girls: The movie uses many different elements from many different Madeline books. It is cute and represents Madeline accurately.
__label__1 Horrible textbook: This book is a terrible, terrible waste of a textbook. The authors spend quite a bit of time talking about absolutely nothing in the book. They oftentimes show examples that are very trite and obvious for anyone to do, but then assign much harder problems. I was very annoyed that they never even bothered to do a complete Kirchoff's rules circuit problem. They emphasize absolutely NO conceptual understanding of the material. I can cite no redeeming qualities of the book except perhaps for decent diagrams.This is written as a graduate physicist; I am no stranger to difficult physics problems. The problems jump from stupidly easy to difficult in a way that is hard for first years, and I sympathize with their difficulty with this book.
__label__1 DON'T BUY THIS BOOK: THIS BOOK IS A PIECE OF CRAP AND A WASTE OF TIME TO FIGURE OUT. I WOULD SUGGEST READING STUFF OFF THE INTERNET AND READING JOURNALS RATHER THAN WASTE TIME WITH THIS PIECE OF TOILET PAPER. I AM GONNA FLUNK THE CLASS CUZ OF THIS PEICE OF CRAP BOOK.DONT BUY THIS BOOK!!!!!!!!!!!AAAHHHHH!!!!
__label__1 ATL really stands for "Absolutely Totally Lame": Just God awful. There were so many plot holes that I kept muttering 'what' to myself half the time, it would cut to a new scene when you thought there would be more dialog, transitioning or introducing a new character would put up text on the screen and pause the movie, which was annoying, the dialog was horrific, and there would be an emotional scene where people are talking, but they must have music or some guy reading poetry dubbed over it and you can't understand what's going on.The rapper T.I. stands for (Total Idiot).
__label__2 Great: This saved our family! My spouse is a very light sleeper. Sounds and other people in house were disrupting his sleep and making him irritable. By having the relaxation sounds, he was able to shut out the other disturbances and have a fitful sleep. I like the projected LCD clock, but you can turn that feature off if you don't like it.
__label__1 By Far The Worst CD Jay-Z has ever had his name on: This is by far the worse CD ever put out by Jay-Z. The beats are weak, His flows sound like a stuttering child when you catch them doing something and they don't know what to say. I can't believe he let this CD get out in the open. I hope to god he realizes this and puts out one more CD before his retirement or else I will be really disappointed.
__label__1 Lacking: So this DVD seemed promising as the menu was up and I was geared up to watch this excellent movie...but then once it started something very important seemed to be missing....yes it was the audio throughout the film. There was audio in the menu but not the actual movie...so that was pretty lame
__label__2 Shopgirl: Shopgirl is one of those books that is really surprising to read. Not only is Steve Martin a great actor, but he is a really great writer as well.This book is about a shopgirl named Mirabelle who works at Neimans department store in the glove department. She dislikes her job because she hardly gets to talk to anyone while doing it. She meets a man while working and is drawn into a relationship with him.The characters in this book are strong and witty. They have problems like everyone else does, but Martin seems to make them easier to understand and see the different point of views from both the male and female side.I really enjoyed this book a great deal and would recommend it to anyone and everyone who lkes a good read.
__label__2 An Angel Sings: Allison does a beautiful job of belting out the heartfelt, emotional End of the World. The second song on this CD is an added bonus. It's uplifting and clever,and Allison sounds like the sweet and playful young lady that she is. Do yourself a favor and order this CD today!
__label__1 A Biased Film ??: They have taken 3 stories and put the women in a worst case scenario. I felt like this film was really trying to push "Pro-Abortion" down my throat, and not very subtley. They are using high drama and emotions to try to influence those who question allowing abortions as a "convenience" for a woman. Very few women have abortions due to life threatening situations. In reality, most abortions are a matter of convenience. Period. Why not be honest about it ??? I wouldn't recommend this film, but if you are really pro-abortion, you would probably like it. This film is biased, but if you realize that up front, then it's okay.
__label__2 Amazing impressions: This guy does hysterical voices and has some interesting takes on people. He's not super serious so if you're looking for the hard hitting political diatribes look elsewhere.
__label__1 Having read the book in class - by Sara Schütz: When I read the reviews of this book by other customers, I thought it would stay pretty close to the surface. But when I read the book by myself, I found out that there where some unexpected depths. But those depths were not numerous and they were too fast settled. I disliked the ending of the story it abolished the big differences between the characters. This made it very uninteresting for me because I think it is very flat to just adapt the characters to each other. I learned nothing from the book and it gave me nothing very emotional so it is no book I would feel reading again. The language of the book is not very poetic or even demanding so there was nothing I wanted to read twice just to enjoy it.But all in all I think the book is okay if you have to read it (in class). At least, it could have been much worse.
__label__2 nice set of songs: THERE IS NOTHING BAD TO SAY ABOUT THIS EXCELLENT COLLECTION OF SONGS,NO MATTER HOW MANY TIMES THEY HAVE BEEN RELEASED BEFORE.THE SONGS HAVE STOOD THE TEST OF TIME AND ARE CLASSIC PERFORMANCES BY THE MOST CLASSIC ENTERTAINER OF ANY GENRE OF ALL TIME.IF YOU DO NOT ALREADY HAVE A COLLECTION OF THESE SONGS I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THAT YOU PURCHASE THIS SET AND ENJOY THE FEEL GOOD MUSIC.THERE IS ONLY ONE ELVIS .
__label__2 Check out "In This Twilight" video by Jennaphoenix: The track "In This Twilight" is a real highlight of this album. You absolutely have to check out the video Jennaphoenix made for it on YouTube. It is titled "NIN - In This Twilight - music video visuals" (Not to be confused with "Nine Inch Nails - "In This Twilight" Movie Music Video" by Editsbydan, which is similar but not nearly as good in my opinion.) Jennaphoenix's collage of images of various apocalyptic movies is quite powerful and fits the song perfectly.
__label__1 Not my cup of tea...: I love vintage music like Bob Wills western swing and even newer bands like Asleep At The wheel. This cd is not too good, the playing isn't authentic western swing, and I don't much care for it, it's slightly annoying...
__label__1 Major Major disappointment: This was a fantastic concert. One that I watched many times after I recorded it on VHS. The highlite of the show was the "everyone" version of "My Back Pages" Where is it? I would love to pay real money to have a good DVD or Blue ray copy. But this half-baked poor excuse of a concert DVD is not at all what I want. Where's the beef?
__label__1 Disappointing: Sorry guys, I looked forward to working on recipes from this cookbook due to the very enthusiastic reception it received from the media. The graphics of the book are truly beautiful. The recipes however, hmmm, try again. I followed a simple recipe for Apple Crisp and got a bad result. I now go to respected standard cookbooks for my Apple Crisp recipe and the old family favorite always turns out great. Really people, the recipes are NOT the stuff of greatness. Graphics? Great. Photography? Great? Recipes? You have got to be kidding
__label__2 Money well spent: This little stick vacuum is perfect for exactly what it is meant to do, quick pick ups. I charged it exactly as directions indicated and it's been great for picking up in the dining area after my little ones. It's also great for a quick pick up on the stairs and entry rugs. I like the versatility of having just a hand vac too.
__label__1 not durable: this opener fell probably 4 feet to a carpeted floor and broke a piece off so now it dont go down enough to even cut.for the money it should withstand about anything.
__label__1 Which Controller is the Phoenix for Xbox or Xbox 360 ?: Ive just recently purchased the Phoenix controller. Is this for xbox or xbox 360. How do use it? Help !!
__label__1 Slightly Better Than a Plastic Basin: This product is only better than buying a cheap plastic basin and filling it with your own warm water for a foot soak. From my experience, the heating element will not even truly keep the water warm (it cooled off within 15 minutes with that turned on), and the massage function is extremely loud and doesn't do much good. The one redeeming quality is the reflexology plates on the bottom -- without those, this would be absolutely useless.
__label__1 THE EMPEROR HAS NO CLOTHES...: I have read several of Gaiman's books and been impressed by his imagination. I absolutely loved Neverwhere and wish desperately for him to write a sequel. This book however, has too much squashed between the pages, characters I don't give a hoot about, obscenities instead of dialogue, weird sex scenes. I found the book convoluted, confusing, disjointed and most of all, just plain boring.
__label__2 Fun: Great book for my son!!! He loves to read with his paper white kindle every night before bed time. Every 1st grader should love these books.
__label__2 I am very pleased for the price: I ended up with these by default. I bought them for my mom for christmas, then found out she wanted some other pans that were not included in this set. So I got her a cuisinart set, and I kept these. I have only used them a couple times, but so far I am pleased. They are a nice weight, they heat well, and the no-stick is great. They have also been very easy to clean. This is my first set of pots and pans that weren't hand-me-down, and I am very happy with them. I hope they hold up well, but considering they are kitchen aid, I don't think that will be a problem.
__label__1 dont: this never played the code was bad and the company never responded to calls or letters what a waist of money
__label__2 An adventurous tale with inspiration for children: This is a wonderful book for both children and adults. For kids it is an adventurous tale about Mooseberry the mouse. The children learn about the importance of Christian values by learning the importance of saying kind words, serving others, sharing, and forgiving people by reading about how Mooseberry, the Mouse, brings color back into the world with the guidance of Captain Chameleon. The amazing thing about this book is the way in which the author handles the religious undertones- right down to the details. Toward the end, the last color left to regain in the rainbow was the color purple which symbolizes the forgiveness that Jesus has given us. As an adult I found myself reading this book to my husband because it was so good!
__label__1 He SCREWED us for Johnny: What the f*ck, Coppola???? Ok, I can understand and appreciate adding the cut footage, but changing the music!!!???? By doing this Coppola has trashed a classic.At the least they could offer a choice of the original film on this DVD. I can't recommend this version. Wait for it to play again on TV, I'm sure AMC is showing it next week...Thank you Baby for my X-mas gift, it's the thought that counts.
__label__1 A poor reference: I have two Thesauri, one at work and one at home. Roget's II, my home thesaurus, is totally inferior to my work thesaurus. The one I use at work, the Oxford American Thesaurus, may not be the best on the market, but it is far superior to Roget's II.
__label__1 Thank god: Thank god this book is out of print but it's to bad the pages weren't blank so that they would fill with color that changed with the light~duh. This clearly illustrates, as long as you stick to one thing; you can be successful, even if it is pointless and meaningless. This is it, an illustration of The Painted Word by Tom Wolfe. Or, you can whip a dead horse so long, but just don't try to ride it.I am amazed that this guy has talked so many folks into buying his paintings (sic) PT Barnum was right.I use my copy to level the workbench in he barn
__label__2 One of Stevenson's Best: Stevenson is best known today as a writer of juvenile fiction. This doesn't do justice to his skills as a writer of historical fiction or his ability to explore psychological and moral issues. Master of Ballantrae is one of his best works. Set in 18th century Scotland, it is an exploration of the nature and relationship between good and evil. In many ways, this is a parallel book to Jekyll and Hyde. In Master, the different aspects of human moral behavior are explored in conflict and relationship of 2 brothers, one charismatic and amoral, the other, stolid and virtuous. This is primarily a psychological novel of family tragedy brought about by the characters of the 2 bothers in a conflict ignited by the Jacobite uprising of 1745. Stevenson does an excellent job of handling the characters and plot. As with his other work, there is a nice depiction of 18th century Scotland. This is not a great work, but it is very good.
__label__2 Improved shower system 2011: I bought this a few weeks back. I had my concerns due to some of the reviews that stated it leaked until you switched out the washers and needed to tighten the diverter. Well Folks Peerless must have paid attention to the concerns. I had absolutely no problems with this unit leaking. It did come with rubber washers, not the plastic ones you read about and were advised to replace and I could not tighten the diverter anymore than it was. So all I can say, is the 2011 version is great specially for the price. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star rating was that I would like more massage setting and the unit not to be plastic. I have to say you get what you pay for and for plactic it seems pretty darn sturdy. I Just told by roommates and also my boyfriend to get one. So I would highly recommend it.
__label__1 Terrible as a walk through gate: We just returned this gate after installing it at the top of our stairs. When used as a hard mounted gate instead of a barrier, the gate expands an extra inch to fit the doorway every time you close the handle. After a few uses the gate is 3 or more inches longer than when you set it to fit the doorway. This means that you have to resize the 2 panels every few times you close it. How annoying! It's like the company didn't test it well enough before releasing it. It's probably great as a pressure mounted barrier but it's horrible as a gate.
__label__2 This is a double feature!: According to the Fox Store, this DVD also contains the 1925 silent version of Lost World, with Wallace Berry, Lewis Stone (Judge Hardy), and Bessie Love. A DVD of this film is available from Image Entertainment, but costs as much as this DVD. I've never seen the 1960 version, but with Raines, Rennie, and Lamas together, how bad can it be?
__label__2 Sci-Fi Greatness: Halo, for the records is a GOOD first-person shooter, but not a greatly exceeding one. Halo uses fine sound, incredible graphics and extraordinary game play that leaves you breathless in your first five minutes of action. The hype did live up and Halo is fun...but there is the con to it. There are only four kinds of alien enemies and they are more cute and dangerous. The weapons are very well created, but there isn't a variety of them, only a pistol, shotgun, rocketlauncher, and rifle. You can use your enemy's weapon and find out they are much better. The use of vehicles in the game add a little more and makes the game good. It's fun and will delight the child in all of us, but there's just not as much to choose from, what you start with in the level, you'll end with, making the overall experience bland.
__label__1 This game sucks: This game has graphics that look like they were done 8 years ago. The sound is horrible. The guy walks so slow I fell asleep. There are no vehicles and no fun. The best part of this game is when you stop playing it!
__label__1 Disappointing....product from Apple: Couldn't set up from my Windows 2K laptop. Could see the SSID of the Airport Express but could never get pass it onto the internet. The Administration config utility never worked for me either. This is my first Apple product....and I was expecting simplicity and plug+play from Apple...but alas this was not to be. Maybe I had a defective one....tried a Netgear WGR101 Travel Router for $79, plugged it in, changed my SSID to match and was on the internet in 3 minutes. The Apple has an elegant compact all in one design, plus the power plug flips down for storage. The Netgear is tiny as well but comes with a separate plug-in pwr supply. The Apple for $129 vs $79 for the Netgear was too much of a value gap to swalllow. So for now I'll say Apple you're fired...Netgear you're hired!
__label__2 Thought-provoking!: This book was far from an easy read, but well worth it. I enjoy books such as this one because it raises many ethical questions about society and technology, etc. Huxley creates a perfect world in which people can do whatever they want and are content with life... but at what cost? Does it even matter if they don't know what they're missing? Is it worth it? Excellent and thought-provoking.
__label__1 Sounds: Sounds doesn't sound like the real things !If I could have listen to it before I bought it I would not have wasted my money!!!
__label__2 A good start.: Despite what's been posted here, this isn't an album of "sunny pop songs". Ralston dwells in break-ups, death, failure on Needle Bed. And it's pretty good stuff, despite that it sounds like it was recorded in a home studio (it partially was). Some of the turn phrases (see No One Said..., Avalanche) seem like abortive attemps at "hooks" - I prefer it when he plays it straight, as with the album's gem, Gone Gone Gone, which with any luck will break into AC radio. Buy and enjoy.
__label__2 A Learning Experience: This was a very good book. When I found out later that this book was recommended for children and young adults to read I was very surprised. I'm not sure if a child would be able to take the emotional heartbreak of this story. But, as for adults, it was very informative and touching. I cried when reading some parts and knowing that when you are living it, you cannot just stop living it, you must go on. The writing is exceptional, not sentimental or romanticized like some books. I looked at the world in a new way after reading this. I don't think my struggles can ever be as bad and if they are I know I can handle them if the girl in this story could.
__label__2 Very satisfied!: I purchased this as a birthday gift for my mother and I am pleased to share that she loved it! It is her favorite fragrance and very difficult to find as it has been discontinued. I was apprehensive about buying perfume online but this was exactly the Vivid fragrance she remembered. I wish everyone else shipped the same quality product.Thanks again for making my mother very happy!
__label__1 Sample vocalist - unwanted: The musical arrangements are good, however the sample vocalist is recorded in the beginning of each track and on both L and R channels and you cannot mute it, therefore you cannot use this for performance. A terrible waste since the music is good quality.
__label__1 Where's my Hotdog?!?!?!: They put 48 songs on this set but leave off "Planet Hotdog"!!! Why can we not get the entire soundtrack? After "Planet Schmanet Janet", it is supposed to go right into "Planet Hotdog" and they CUT IT OFF!!! This really cheeses me off to no end!!!
__label__2 Very good: I am a big Bernard Cornwall fan and heard good things about this series. I was not disapointed, am I looking forward to reading more of the series.
__label__2 Works Great...: The ink arrived when it was supposed to. Installing the ink was not hard to do.The only complaint would be that the ink runs out incredibly fast. This ink cartridgecannot handle too many prints before you have to change it again.
__label__2 What is there to say?: Purchased this book for my 11yr old granddaughter. Was surprised at how quickly I received it! Not much else to say - the book is a classic!
__label__1 Somebody spilled their Lil Jon all over my Shadow: When it's at its best, it sounds like the gorillaz on an off day. When it's at it's worst, it could be used to coax Osama out of a cave. I thought it was a mistake. I put the CD in and then pulled it out around track 4 to make sure it wasn't a mix up at the factory and I got the new crunk in the trunk mixtape. I look forward to the make-up album that should come out soon in an effort to save face.
__label__2 This is a Christmas gift for my daughter haven't tried it yet: This is a Christmas gift for my daughter so she hasn't tried it yet but from what i can see it looks good from the case and it arrived in good timing before Christmas.
__label__1 I don't hear any "punk" here.....: this garbage may not be as popular as Blink 182 or New Found Glory or other crap of the like, but it still sure sucks! I always hear about how "MXPX are REAL pop-punk, not like New Found Glory or Good Charlotte or any crap like that!"- um, I think MXPX ARE "crap like that!" Wearing skater clothes & having spiked hair & writing about how hard of a life you have because you can't get the girls you want is not "punk"- Go listen to some Pennywise- they look normal and they write great songs about the problems of our society and standing up to choose your own life, THAT'S what REAL PUNK is!MXPX sucks, BIG TIME, just as much as Blink 182, Good Charlotte, New Found Glory, The Ataris, and all other boy bands with guitars!
__label__1 not durable: I didn't use this ball very much (twice a week at top), but it developed a leak in 5 months. Very disappointed. Not durable.
__label__2 The Brazilian Brigand, Lampiao: This is the only book so far on Lampiao in English. It is a riveting account. Besides his ugly side toward informants who ratted on him, Chandler mentions Lampiao had a humane side toward those who supported him and his brigands. Chandler also describes some of the tactics the Bandit King used to elude the "volantes" (police) --- walking backwards over their footprints, and wearing animalskins on their shoes to avoid leaving footprints, among others. But for how long can one continue to literally get away with murder?? The atrocities he committed on his enemies are squeamish to read (I won't mention them, here). For these gory acts, it is no wonder he and his gang met their grisly end in Angicos. Also, the book is very descriptive about life in Northeastern Brazil during the 1920's and '30's. While reading, I've tried to envision these isolated areas with their arid, rough terrain. An interesting, yet, at times, disturbing, biography.
__label__1 opening in top too small: I bought these shoes because I wear the same size in all my Steve Madden shoes and they do not fit. The problem is that the opening in the top of the boot in much smaller than my foot, so it is almost impossible to actually get my foot into the boot. I did manage to get the left foot in, and I know that the shoe fits because once I actually had my foot in the boot I had plenty of room and it looked cute. My right foot, on the other hand, will not fit into the top of the boot. I guess I will try to put them on again tomorrow but for now I am thoroughly disappointed with the fact that it is a struggle and I can still only get one boot on.
__label__1 Not so good: If I were to compile a greatest hits of Modest Mouse I would take track six and track ten from this album...the rest really don't work for me. There are better Modest Mouse albums to buy...don't waste your money.
__label__1 Very dissapointing: My wife and I loved this show until we got to the fourth season. Now it's just F word after F word and pointless nude scenes. I really don't know what they were thinking when they brought all of this filth into the show. I don't think we are going to bother watching the rest of the season, it's just a waste of time now.
__label__2 krups gusto 880: I purchased this on ebay at a very reasonable price. (under 50.00)I can't understand what people are complaining about. The unit heats the water on one circuit and them pumps the water with the other. Simple physics here. You control the amount of water passing through. I have gotten the crema on every shot so far.The espresso flavor is controlled by the quality of bean that you buy and amount of water that you allow to pass. Obviously, if you are trying to get too much out of your beans and dilute the shot;its your fault for a poor cup of espresso. My expresso taste great and it certainly gives me the caffeine buzz. Try sweetening up the expresso with condensed sweetened milk (like eagle brand).No complaints here for the functioning of the product. No leaks so far. You can't beat the price of the unit either at this amazon site for new or on the ebay site for the refurbished units which will go for under [price]. Five stars for price to value here.
__label__1 architect: a book of little not saying any use at all, it gives maybe just only one idea containted in it's title (but you don't have to buy the whole book to grasp the word) and for the same purpose you can find a better one by substracting the word modern of it if you are anxious for a book, if not, I would recommend the web.
__label__2 Amazin: The story of a missionary back in the 60's/70's working with traveling hippies on the "Trail" from the Eastern world to Amsterdam. He was working with people addicted to drugs, sex, and searching for answers. This book is just his stories of how he lived life and what happened to them, how God provided, how Satan attack, and how he did his best to follow what God was calling him to do in a very difficult place. Amazing stories and it makes you really look at where your 'safety' is found.The author is the man that started the ministry Youth with a Mission-for those that are interested
__label__1 Disappointed!: Okay, now anyone who reads V.C. Anndrews' novels knows that there are always 5 books! With 5 books you get the explanation of how the whole mess started in the first place. As far as I can tell there is no plan for the 5th book. But that is not the only reason I am giving this book a low rating. The other is that it was the worst one in the whole series, which was unimpressive to begin with. But the bad thing about a series is that once you begin them you just have to finish-if you know what I mean. The main character for End of the Rainbow, Summer is not one that you can fall into, and is very unbelievable and one dimensional. The plot is boring. This book is written in V.C. Andrews form but it has none of her style. I suggest if you want to read V.C. Andrews, read V.C. Andrews, and not a ghost writter who can't fill her shoes!
__label__1 Arrow buttons broken: See title, not happy at all.The whole reason I ordered it was for a game that requires the arrow buttons on the left.
__label__2 Benny and Joon: I'd forgotten what a great movie this is! Johnny Depp, Mary Stuart Masterson, and Aidan Quinn are fabulous. This most untraditional romance will really touch your heart.
__label__2 Prompt: Received this book promptly and received it in the condition as mentioned. Thanks for your business.
__label__2 Excellent explanations of difficult topics: The author, David Kahn does a superb job of explaining in clear, simple, casual manner many of the more difficult topics cover on the AP Calculus exams. He provides numerous step-by-step instructions of how to master many types of problems and also gives a lot of quick tips and tricks. He has obviously had much experience teaching this course. This book is amazingly easy, even fun, to read. There are numerous examples, practice problems and actual exam-type questions. I found this book organized and written in a way that makes it stand out from all other books of its type. I especially found it more readable and useful than the long-time favorite in its class - Baron's AP Calc. Review.
__label__1 HOW DARE YOU WACHOWSKI BROTHERS! WHAT IS THIS!?: WHAT ON EARTH WERE THEY THINKING!?! THE MATRIX WAS PRETTY GOOD! AND THEN THE MATRIX RELOADED WAS BETTER THAN THAT! AND THEN CAME THIS WORTHLESS LITTLE SPECK! THIS IS BY FAR THE WORST MOVIE I'VE EVER SEEN IN ANY TRILOGY! THE BEST THING I CAN SAY ABOUT THIS MOVIE IS THAT IT WASN'T AS LONG AS THE OTHERS! IT'S FLASHY, BUT BORING! THE SCRIPT IS PRETTY BAD, AND THERE'S VIRTUALLY NO PLOT. AND WHEN AGENT SMITH GOES (...) AT THE END, THERE'S NO EMOTIONAL IMPACT. THIS IS REALLY NOT WORTH SEEING, SO I'LL TELL YOU EVERYTHING IMPORTANT. TRINITY GETS IMPALED. THE HUMANS AND THE MACHINES MAKE A TRUCE. A FEW PEOPLE NAMELESS FACELESS PEOPLE GET RIPPED TO SHREDS. NEO KILLS SMITH. NEO DIES TOO. SOME LITTLE GIRL CREATES A SUN IN THE MATRIX. THE END.
__label__2 Foyle's War, Simply the Best: Foyle's War is simply one of the best of the numerous British mystery series produced. As a fan of the genre I feel this is one of my all time top three series. Michael Kitchen is superb.
__label__2 Demented but great: This CD is defenitly not for kids. It's violent, and drug oriented, and hilarius at the same time. It's also much better than the "Marshal Mathers LP". The reason I only gave it a four stars is becuase it has a lot of negativity in it. Even though he talks about killing his wife in "97' bonie and clide" you can hardly take any of it seriusly. The one I can't stand is "Still don't give a f__k". The violence in it is outrageous. Parents beware.....
__label__2 YES, PLEASE - A MUST HAVE for your Collection!!: Fourplay does it again! With this amazing collection of songs featuring top notch performances from these world class musicians, Bob James, Nathan East, Larry Carlton and Harvey Mason. Yes, Please continues in their tradition of magical sounding recordings (good for testing any stereo system), substantial songs (not just boring drum machine grooves) and some great playing from this Supergroup! This could be my favorite Fourplay recording yet but I love them all. Rush out and get it today only if you love fine music.
__label__2 Tested with Dr.: I took this product with me on my last Doctor visit. Her nurse and than she took my blood pressure the old way (manually) and than tested it with the Omron. All three were very close. I think now she will believe me that my blood pressure is lower at home than in her office. The software and the Omron work well.
__label__1 Jeep seat covers: While installing the lines that are used to senched the cover down broke with minor pulling so the seat cover is loose and not real great looking.
__label__2 it works: would have given it a 5 star, were it not for the bulkiness. price is good and it is a no brainer to use. would recommend this product
__label__1 Stay away from Roxio: After buying this, it installed a lot of programs that I didn't want. When I tried to selectively install what I did want, none of the programs would work. So I had to do a full install. Video editing would lock up every 10 or 20 minutes, which was usable I just saved often. Then it started locking up every minute which wasn't enough time to get anything done. On their customer forums, every problems seems to be answered with "uninstall and do a clean reinstall." I had done that twice already so I gave up and uninstalled it to move on to something new. Now it has broken my codecs and won't play any video without asking for a file that I can't find. This software is nothing but a huge hassle and waste of money. Instead of making patches they just start selling suite 10 which is probably just as bad.
__label__2 A Must See...: I recently began purchasing BSG to watch and, although I don't much care for the split seasons, I am extremely happy with this show. For anyone who is a fan of sci-fi or just great productions, BSG is the one for you.
__label__1 Silly: I'm amazed looking at the other reviews for this book that they are all so good. I was very disappointed in this book. I have read several other John Saul books and this is by far the worst I've read. I found it slow moving and the premise weak. The ending seemed as though the whole exercise of writing the thing had been so painful he just wanted to be done with it.I will say that it's been many years since I last read a John Saul book and I may have just grown out of them.
__label__1 Worst intro to string theory ever written: This book is little more than an incoherent compilation of research papers. It is worse than useless.
__label__2 Wonderful: Very helpful with cold and aching hands at work. Everyone asks me and I give them one.They all love it too...
__label__1 More like a personal diary: First of all, if you're serious about out-of-body or lucid dreaming check out "Astral Dynamics" by Robert Bruce. That's the bible. Now, "Conscious Dreaming" consists of personal stories and some shamanic rituals, but lacks power techniques for advanced dreamers. Anyway it's ok for beginners, who seek motivation for out-of-body exploration. It's also recommended by Marc VanDeKeere in his excellent "The Ultimate Lucid Dreamer's Manual: From Basics to Beyond".
__label__2 Can't beat the convenience!: Thank goodness organic food has become more readily available. Organic brown rice in 1 minute? Great! It is very sticky, but I heat it, throw in a little butter, spices, mix in a few veggies, and it's a healthy quick meal for my 3-year-old. He loves it!
__label__1 It vibrates: Don't buy this unit. After running a Haier wine cellar for ~4 years, I lost my entire wine collection. Why? Vibrations. After pulling bottle after bottle of wine and finding that they had gone off, I began investigating why. At first I thought it was temperature fluctuations, or the fact that the tinted glass may not be UV resistant. However, the final answer came when I tested for vibrations. And there are *a lot* of vibrations in the interior. I lost 60+ bottles of premium wine; don't make the same mistake.
__label__2 Beautiful, poetic, sensual, realistic: I can't say enough good things about this truely lovely book. It is a highly evocative and sensual portrayal of a lesbian who has been recently diagnosed with MS. An all too rare realistic description of the disabled ... world, including financial stress, activism and really hot sex (yay!).
__label__1 the wedding dress: I wish this would have a little more back bone. Maybe I just like longer movies. If it were a little more meaty with a little longer plot it would have been a great movie. Instead it leaves you hanging and saying what?
__label__2 Betty's cute: Slightly cheesey (I mean, really, what did you expect), but incredibly funny!!!! There are some amazing one-liners in these episodes! Fun characters---some that you love, and some that you love to hate. And who can't relate to trying to fit in? Quite a few episodes.
__label__2 Ain't That Cute: I think this is a great CD, my favorite song would have to be Ain't that cute. Other good songs are "Crazy little party girl," "One bad apple," "I'm gonna miss you forever," "Shack it," and "Crush on you." I would recomend this CD to anyone who likes the Backstreet Boys.
__label__2 Best Tucker!: In my opinion, this is the one of the best Tucker compilations available---better than the later release "Where a Country Boy Belongs." If you like the MTB and you like Country Rock, this is a CD for you. Hopefully it will be re-released at some future date.
__label__2 It wasn't so hard to read after all: When I saw what the would topic of this book was, I was afraid that it would be too difficult a read. It was actually very engaging and fresh, although a little tough to follow at times. All in all, I enjoyed it quite a lot, and didn't get bummed out by the topic.
__label__2 Captivating: I work in the field of pediatric cardiology, and a coworker recommended this book to me. To be honest, I was expecting a much less humble account from the perspective of the surgeon. I found "Walk on Water" to be a beautiful tribute to the complexity of congenital heart disease, as well as an intimate account of the family experience. It highlighted the inner workings of what it takes to operate on the hearts of small and fragile children, which I found fascinating -- however, it also highlighted the impact of the intra-op and post-op teams that keep these children alive.The technical jargon was, I feel, understandable and easy to comprehend. It might be a little difficult for a non-medical person, but Ruhlman provides decent explanations at every turn.Overall, a captivating look at a tiny subset of medicine.
__label__2 Thanks to her! I'm loving football: I love it. It's funny but yet serious. I was able to enjoy myself reading the book. NOthing boring. Everything is in detail.
__label__1 Didn't carbonate: I bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas and we were really excited about this. We have friends into beer making and he had always wanted to brew beer so we were hoping this would get us familiar with the process. We followed the simple instructions and when the time had come we tried the beer and it was horrible. No carbonation, it was just flat, nasty beer. So disappointed. :(
__label__2 Great sidekicks!!!: The chemistry between the boy and the fisherman is unique and heartwarming. Their relationship changes as the movie goes on and that one dynamic by itself would have made the movie great regardless of the scenes.
__label__2 PHENOMENON: THIS IS A STORY OF AN SMALL TOWN WNERE EVERYONE KNOWS PRETY MUCH EVERYONE. AND OF A GOOD MAN ( JOHN TRAVOLTA ) WHO IS TOUCHED BY A LIGHT OUT OF THE SKY. WETHER IT BE THE FINGER OF GOD OR SPACE AILEAN IS FOR YOU TO DESIDE. AT ANY RATE IT LEAVES HIM WITH SPECIAL POWERS AND AN UNSABUAL NEED FOR KNOWLEDGE. REEDING MORE AND MORE BOOKS AND SLEEPING LESS CHANGES HIM AND PEOPLE START TO TALK. HE GOES TO THE DOCTTOR PLAYED BY ( ROBERT DUVALL ) WHO SUPPORTS HIM TO THE END. THIS IS A MUST WATCH MOVIE AND A GEM FOR THE COLLECTORS. I HIGHLY RECOMEND IT.
__label__1 Just plain nasty!: Dermablend Leg and Body Cover reminds me alot of mud. You know how you get mud on your shoes and it is dark at first but then dries to look alot lighter and flakes off? That's a very accurate comparison to this product. It sets to a very chalky, dry, finish which appears flaky and has a pasty, corpse like gray tinge to it. It is creepy looking! Even with all of the colors that are available it still looks unnatural and ashy when dry.The only way I was able to use it was to cover my tattoo with the product and then disguise the hideously fake makeup under a pair of thick, shimmery dance tights!! You couldn't pull it off with just the makeup on your bare skin though.It would be great if you want to dress up like a mummy or decaying corpse for Halloween though.
__label__2 Another Great Film: Yet another great film from the director of "Priscilla, Queen of the Desert". There are too many "laugh-out-loud" moments in this movie to mention. Loved It!!!!!!!
__label__1 Unless you've been there.: If you haven't been to Italy, and you're not going, why read this tedious book? It is not for the light-hearted!
__label__2 KitchenAid FGA Food Grinder works as expected: The price was excellent at 30% below retail. Delivery was quick. We've used it to grind venison and chicken and it does a great job. Easy to clean too.
__label__1 Not appropriate for table top use.: The gain on this mic is horrible. I was hoping to use four of them as desktop mic's for a conference we have coming up. Unless your directly on top of this mic it picks up less than my $5 dollar Nady condenser mic.
__label__2 Excellent CD that almost no one has heard!: Jimmer Podraski was a member of the great band The Rave-Ups. When that band folded, he started The Lovin' Miserys, and I waited a long time to get this CD. It was unavailable everywhere, and I almost doubt that it actually got a proper release. Many years after it was supposed to come out, I managed to lay my hands on a copy of it, and it was well worth the wait. It's really a shame that this CD hasn't reached more people 'cause it's an excellent follow up to all the great Rave-Ups releases. Great melodic rock/pop with a roots touch as well. If you ever see this CD, don't hesitate to pick it up 'cause it'll most likely be the only copy you'll ever see.
__label__2 Great Guitarmusic: This summer in a restaurant in Dubai we heard this great easy-listening-guitarmusic for the first time.We asked the waiter for information about the guitarplayers.When coming home we looked for the music at Amazon-shop and found the 2 Midnight Guitar CD's.Great !!!
__label__1 Dont Buy: This happens to be the worst item to spend your your money on. I live in the Bahamas and i ordered this head phone on line so i had to wait a few day to get it but once i got it and tried it out, it sounds ok but it just start to fall apart on tha first night i had to use it. I wish i could get my money back, spend the extra and get something worthwhile.
__label__1 Terry Pratchett Classic: My friend in England strongly recommended I try to locate this trilogy. She was entirely correct!
__label__1 Sadly disappointed: I wanted to like this book as it is so highly praised by people I admire. It was a selection for our church book club and I'm glad I had exposure to Father Nouwen's interpretation of the message of the Prodigal Son, one of my favorite New Testament passages. Unfortunately it did not arouse much spirituality in me. I felt that Father Nouwen overworked the connectedness between his own experiences and the biblical message. It was a long slog to finish the book which engendered guilt in me for not being more moved by Father Nouwen's words. He was a dedicated and thoughtful Christian who lead an exemplary life of charity and service but his message here was diminished by repetition. Prudent editing would have resulted in a more readable and inspirational book.
__label__1 Thomas Loader is not for hand-on children: My 3 year old son is a huge Thomas the Tank Engine fan - he has the train table and the wooden trains which he plays with constantly. He received the Big Big Loader as a gift. After we put it all together he was quite frustrated that it just goes by itself, he cannot interact with it. As another reviewer stated this is not a "toy" since they cannot "play" with it - they just sit there and watch it. Also, Lorry # 1 and Thomas do not stay on the track. They are constantly derailing when they come out of the turn about station. The toy claims it is easy for little hands to use but I beg to differ. My son cannot get them to stay on the track when he tries to do it himself, I can barely do it! So, bottom line is if your child likes to actually play with toys instead of sitting there staring at them, this product is not for them!
__label__1 Not a good wedding selection of music: I didn't like this CD because none of the recordings were done by the original artist and it had a "muzack" quality to it. It was not at all helpful in planning my wedding. The song selection wasn't bad but the recording artists were terrible!
__label__2 sturdy & good: great pull up bar, the mounts are a bit wide for most doors, so for me I could only fit 2 of the screws in. However 2 is definitely enough to make it very stable. Great for the price (was cheaper than what is above right now) :P
__label__1 terrible reception: i own this card and the reception is horrible. i had to purchase a 3com card to replace it.works fine if your access point is very close but i would just recommend going with something like 3com for just a few bucks more.
__label__1 badly produced christian right scfi prodution: only watched one of three... disappointed at it.. why didn't it show where the raptured went... did not take into accounts of end of days that other philosphys have... highly disappointed... anyone who is a student of spiritual philosophy should avoid this narrow minded and tunnel vision of the religious righteous
__label__2 The Code Talker Review: This book is a great part of history that makes you want to read more and more after every chapter. It teaches you about the Navajo marines of World War 2. Two words; spontaneous and action packed. I loved it when it was talking about the Kamikaze airplanes, atomic bomb, and the Pearl Harbor attack. I give it a 4 out of 5 stars.
__label__2 Music Connoseur: One of the best kept secrets in soul ballads. Easy listening with a powerful message of love for lovers, with such tunes as "Someone Gotta Win and Someone Gotta Lose" and "When I'm Away" and the powerful remix of Stevie Wonders' hit, "Very Superstitious." One of the best music groups from Birmingham, AL, the home of such greats as Eddie Kendricks,and Paul Brown. The Controllers are long overdue for super stardom.
__label__1 Doodoo: Method Man can sum up my review in three words: Doodoo is doodoo. People, this "book" is certainly doodoo.
__label__1 Ari Daidouji: This book SUCKS! I hated this book and I recomened that you just turn around. I hated this book from cover to cover and I'm sure that you will too
__label__2 AWSOME !: The Graphics in this game are cool.The code is tight, no glitches.The action comes at you from all angles, but you havethe guns to take them on. There are many different kindsof enemies. This is a hardcore, well designed FPS, butdon't expect a deep plot, becuase it's not meant to bethat kind of game. You can always download the freedemo & the demo patch first, which is what I did.J.R.
__label__1 Read this before you buy!: ... I am glad I did not order this book, I wrote down some samples ofcontacts that was suggested would help an african american woman tostart a small business. I say this, "Wait for an updatedversion." This is the millennium programs and contacts havechanged drastically. If consumers will stop sending this guy moneyfor an outdated book maybe he will realize he needs to make an updatedversion. You reviewers who say that anyone giving this book a badreview are not willing to work are mistaken. I am willing to work, Ijust happen to think $40 something dollars is more then I am willingto pay for outdated programs and information.
__label__1 What Were They Thinking???: I watched this movie at the theaters when it came out. Being a fan of the Bewitched series, I went with a friend who begged me to go see this "remake?". What a letdown. First of all, Nicole Kidman as Samantha???? Bad Choice!!! That was almost an insult to Bewitched fans. She was so unconvincing as Samantha. As far as Will Ferrell, I hated his performance in this movie, not that I enjoy any of his performances. This movie was actually boring and not funny at all. It's the kind of movie that makes you want to leave the theater. I don't know what they were thinking when they made this film, but they surely were not thinking right. This is one movie that I will not be watching again. You expect a great movie and end up with a terrible one!!
__label__1 The sap runneth over: Wow! This song is by far the worst wedding song I have ever heard. It is so sappy it makes me cringe. I'm not saying she has a bad voice, or the lyrics are bad...but it sounds like some kids CD from the 80's. My fiance loves Slipknot. I think he would rather dance to Pulse of the Maggots than this crud.
__label__2 Not enough: It is a good DVD for a Moody Blues fan.It does not contain enough songs/videos for a non-fan, to see the true greatness of the band.
__label__1 Bummer: I have had many casio products and have been very satisfied including this watch. It worked perfectly until the battery died. I had the battery replace and the watch wouldn't keep time. I returned the watch to casio for repair and was told it would be $47.00. I am sad to find out casio makes a "Throw away" product. I have always considered casio watches the very best of the working man's watch. I can no longer reconmend casio watches.
__label__2 Expensive but worth it.: It's insane to spend $180 for a piece of plastic, but it's also insane to spend $400 on a camera and then need to buy disposable cameras when you go scuba diving. This is a nice design, not too heavy, and it does the job perfectly. I only wish it were half the price.
__label__1 Lesser Vicente Fernandez film.: This film takes place during the Mexican revolution and deals with the story of a revolutionary fighter and an upper class woman who meet and who he has to tame to his way of thinking, although the film begans trying to recreate the era by the middle of the film the director seems to have forgotten it's supposed to be a period film, the film has many sexist ideas and treats the female character like a thing that has to be tamed to the man's way of thinking by the end of the film the whole story falls apart and what could have been a better film is lost by it's mediocre story and the bad acting of the lead actress Julieta Rosen, what results is a tired formulaic movie with no new ideas.
__label__1 Very disappointing: I was disappointed with this book. There are not many craft ideas that I would attempt with children, especially a group of children. I originally bought this thinking I could use some ideas for our Bible School classes or for one of our Girl Scout outings. I was hoping for some ideas that were a little easier. Most of these you have to stay with your child and do it with them. Today parents have to do so much homework with children that it would be nice if they could have a few craft projects that they could do by themselves or with a friend after school for pleasure. There are some ideas here but I am going to use only 4 of the projects. If you like to sit and do this with your child and in most cases, do this for your child because it is too hard, then buy the book. I found much more fun ideas by searching Google for popsicle crafts.
__label__1 waste of money :( soooo tiny.: when i pulled out the box, i thought they had confused my order with a deck of playing cards. yep, it's that small. Barely enough of anything to be called a Weekender Kit. Don't even bother.
__label__1 There is nothing "natrual" this product.: Look up the ingredients on the cosmetic database website (google for it). This is a typical product that is sold and packaged as beingearth friendly but is far from it. You have to do your research when it comes to buying "natural" products. Any company can put that word on there but it doesn't mean a thing. Stay with the reputable, truly natural products and companies.
__label__2 Good product: The gauge I'd a good product. What you can't really see from the photo is the air chuck (where the user connects the gage to the tire) is a straight connection, not turned at an angle as most gauge's are. This item is for home use, as it's a bit lightweight to hold up for commercial use.
__label__1 utter DISsatisfaction: I feel Wendy's fascination with muriel was a bit uncalled for and frankly showing signs of immaturirty that in the stage of our nation, we simpy DO not need. Our nation is in somewhat of a "gray" area now, and the last thing my, or anyone elses child needs, is to have one more thing to thik about. Thank you, and goodnight.
__label__2 Spooky: I had not even heard of this author before and started reading, not knowing what to expect. The book was well written and really reminded me of Stephen King books. It was gripping and the characters were believable. The end wasn't great but after reading this book I have downloaded another 2 and am currently reading one called KIN that is excellent and I would highly recommend it.
__label__1 poor reprint: Be careful buying from Pop Culture Graphics, I purchased 10 posters from them and all the 27x40 are low quality reproductions. The Monsters Inc. poster came with smudges from their printing methods. The lettering is fuzzy and the overall image resolution is very pixelated. For the amount that they are charging, I suggest spending a little more and purchase them from a legitimate poster/print dealer.
__label__2 This game can be fun, educational and grow with your child: To start out--I am a huge Scrabble fan so this would seem like a math version to me and yes, I loved it! It required advanced thinking and is really best to be learned with a small child--who is just learning to count and build up to the adult challenges. Having that child make equal math statements 1+4=5=3+2 can really help the child open up to multi-leval thinking instead of just memorizing facts. My kids are 4,9,10,12 and can play together as long as they help the little one (or he gets paired with mom or dad). And I would NOT say this is something they would get out and play for 'fun' but it is a fun game to play and challenge ourselves to think outside the box. I do wish, however, that the game had wooden tiles instead of plastic for the numbers. The parenthesis tiles do need to be clear to overlay.
__label__2 Amazing gym bag: To help give you an idea of how big it is; I carry a pair of gym shoes, a pair of gym shorts, one tank top, one water canteen, one gym towel, two bottles of workout supplements, one stick of deodorant, one can of body spray, and my laptop charger. Even with all of that in there, I am only taking up half of the bag. It seems very durable, I been using it everyday for school and I have not seen any visible signs of wear. It looks and feels very durable. Overall great buy for the price.
__label__2 You'll want a joystick: This was also my first introduction to multiplayer gaming. A fully 3-D environment in which one can become completely immersed. You'll want a joystick to play this one as there are a LOT of controls to manipulate. Definitely dated, but still a blast to play.
__label__2 Worth the Purchase!: I saw this fight flick on Showtime and had to add it to my library.Chad Ortis "Mike Dublin" should become an A-Lister - he's a very good actor. He times throw-aways well and was a convincing sleazoid manager.Rebecca Neunswander is captivating in her role as the fighter and she's also a very good actress. Ortis and Neunswander should do more films together - there was some great chemistry.Despite all it's violence and blood gore, there's something about this movie that wins you over. Perhaps it's the great dialog between the characters? Kudos to writer Ian Schorr for excellent screenwriting.(Disclaimer: I do not know any of these people. I was simply impressed that they created a fight flick that was actually interesting to watch, was well-written and acted -- and it stayed clear of the all-too typical fight movie cliches.)Go "Speedy"! ;)
__label__1 My God! If the sky was falling, it would be GOOD news!: I didn't believe it was possible. This movie made Leaving Las Vegas seem spiritually uplifting. If you have ANY psychological abnormalities - neuroses, tendencies toward depression, suicide, etc... - DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE!I really regret the 50 cents I spent on it.
__label__1 Terrible. Not funny.: Not funny. The plot was senseless and the characters all seemed too old to be typically considered bride and bridesmaids. The lead character was so unlikable that I can't even remember her name. None of the female characters were likable, actually. The only reason I gave this two stars is because I liked the cop. I have no idea what he was supposed to have found charming and lovable about the selfish, trashy, drunken, 'maid' of honor. Oh, except at some point he apparently had bought cakes in a shop she'd owned, and thought she was a great baker.
__label__1 loser: at first i did not like the book but now that i learned more it is tight! IT is but i give it a 2
__label__1 The old version was better...: I have the original UK book from the '70's and have used it so much it's falling apart. It has some wonderful recipes that have become family favorites. I was prepared to throw it away for the newer version. But when I got it and started looking through it, I was disappointed. It's got nicer font than the old one but I thought in a newer version there would be color photos. Nope. And they have trimmed some of the content! I was kind of upset! So it really isn't the same book I thought I was getting. So for now I keep using the old book in the boring font with no photos but with the 20 or so pages included that they didn't see fit to print in the new version. And I'll just keep taping in those pesky pages that keep falling out...
__label__2 A great work of art: This book works on so many levels, it's mind boggling...it's an adventure story, it's a philosophical novel of ideas, it's got brilliant use of language. Like a painter, Conrad creates effects by deciding what to put in and what to leave out; he shifts narrators and fractures the time sequence to get maximum impact from his story. If you don't get it the first time, try again (I've read it many, many times). It's pure poetry and a genuinely profound book. The review below from VA that describes Conrad's theme (facing your fears) is totally right on the money -- so face your fears about reading a difficult book, buy a copy of Lord Jim and read it, and you'll be a better person for the experience.
__label__1 This was the worst: I order this produt over a month ago and I still am waiting on it and I am very disapointed it the service at amazon.com What I would sugest is that you find an item on amazon and the go to the site of the company yourself and order it without the middle man
__label__2 Better track listing than the US release: Although this collection doesn't follow chronological order like the US release, I still prefer it because it contains one hit that was not included on the US version, "Soul Inspiration." It also includes "When You Love Someone" (a duet with James Ingram) and "Good Enough," one of the best tracks from GIVING YOU THE BEST THAT I'VE GOT.
__label__2 The Last American Virgin: Love it, "They're not dead" is one of my favorite scenes in this movie!!! A lot of fun...
__label__1 horrible: The book is not well organized. The dates jump around making it confusing to follow the history of it. I have seen the newest version and notice that it is much better organized than this version.
__label__1 Worst ending for a book ever...: Tom, you should have kept Lecter in jail. While he was incarcerated, he was far more creepy and threatening. Once he escapes, he becomes omnipotent, and thus, far less interesting. During the course of the book, we learn that Hannibal Lecter can: read people's minds, hypnotize animals, kill anyone at anytime anywhere in the most complex way with absolutley no forethought, outwit the entire world, flasify any document no matter how complex, speak 18 languages, whip up gourmet meals made of brains, and convince Agent Starling that she's his wife. The lead-in to the last few chapters was great, and is totally ruined by the ending which seems like it was written as an afterthought. If you liked Silence of the Lambs, this book will piss you off! There's a reason why Jody Foster refused to play Clarice in the movie adaptation of Hannibal! Trust me on this one...
__label__2 Heart Felt: This story grabbed me from the start and you could feel the roller coaster of emotions throughout the story. It was very well written and expressed.
__label__2 A Must Read: This book is excellent and a must read for all gay men and mental health professionals who work with gay men. It is written in a clear and easy to understand style and is so on point.
__label__1 Not What I Was Looking For: I thought this would be full of helpful insight into how to deal with the added stress/effort/etc of having two kids instead of just one...it's basically a repeat of any baby book you already own and offered little, if any, in the way of new ideas. Bummer.
__label__1 Hot and Cold pack...think again: I'm sure if I was using this for heat it would be pretty good. I stuck it in the freezer overnight and the coldness only lasted 30 minutes max. Disappointed and will be using the blue ice packs that are for lunches for my migraines.
__label__1 cheaply made: This product has already fallen apart, and all I have in it is DVD's. I would not recommened this product to anyone, since it is junk.
__label__1 The Options Course: The book was below average, although it can give novice trader a little idea on what options are and how they work. Basically, I was letdown on the topics covered, and how the title exagerates on its claim. Read it if you are a beginner, but not if you are familiar w/options looking for some new strategies.
__label__1 Begginer content written for an expert: This has begginer level content, although is too complex for any begginer. Only purchase this book if you already know C and Perl, and have no knowledge of CGI.There are much better simple free tutorials online that could describe the basis of CGI.
__label__2 Good elementary introduction: This is an elementary introduction to drilling. It avoids detail but provides a good first step without intimidating the reader. It breaks down the components of a rig and the various services that go into construction of an oil or gas well.
__label__2 Vandoren B45 Dot Bb Clarinet Mouthpiece Review: What a bargain! I got it for half the retail price, brand new. A much smoother sound. It was my first purchase from Amazon and it won't be my last.
__label__1 Would Not Play On My DVD Player: Unfortunately, I was unable to play this DVD. I returned it for another one, and that one wouldn't play either. I've never had any problems playing any other DVDS and another product I ordered at the same time played fine. I was disappointed, as I really wanted to try this one out.
__label__2 Good book, bad exam!: The book isn't the problem... the problem is decoding Cisco's cryptic questions on the exam! Be sure to go over the Case Study sections of this book a few times, you'll need to be familar with the style for this exam!
__label__2 Fit for A King!: This CD shows that the music relates to all ages and Elvis has certainly shown that nearly 25 years after his death. Regardless of the changes in the musical structure and the instrumental structure of the new millenium, he still shows that he appeals to all ages. I have a large number of his recordings, and I should know! I understand that there is a lot of comparison among different styles of music, but Elvis still outshines them all! Great work!!
__label__2 A good introduction: This book was written for the Cultures of the Past series, and is intended for juvenile readers. For being so small (69 pages, including the glossary), it does succeed in giving an overview of its subject. The book covers the Persians from prehistory, through the conquest by the Arabs in 642. It also describes their culture, covering such things as architecture, food and clothing, religion, and much else.This book is not perfect; indeed, calling Salamis a Greek colony on the island of Cyprus is a glaring error. However, this book has many excellent pictures, and its layout does make it a very good introduction to the subject. Overall, I do recommend this book.
__label__2 My daughter loves it!: My daughter received this toy as her first birthday prensent from her grandparents. She started to play with it from age of 15 months. She loves it! She can sit and spin by herself now (18 months) and when we have her friends come over to our home, other kids also likes to play with it. I guess kids likes to spin and spin!
__label__2 Sturdy: The item is very sturdy and looks beutiful. It comes with an access panel in the back for cables.
__label__1 Awful - stay away: We tried watching this movie but had to stop because (1) it just wasn't funny and (2) it was pretty raunchy. Wish I could get my money back...
__label__2 Rich in detail, memorable in story: Essentially a 'Choose Your Own Adventure' book with some basic RPG elements (Dungeons and Dragons -type mechanics) made this an accessible book when I read it years ago. The descriptions - of ninja monks and terrible creatures, barbarian warriors, blizzard covered mountains, and shifty political figures - led me to read and re-read the book cover to cover to learn how all the different story branches could turn out.I only read the first in the series (this one) and for a number of years after would poke around in bookstores or Scholastic catalogs (this was pre-'net) hoping to find the next. Lots of fun. Parents might want to skim these before giving to their pre-teen (the intended market I think) to make sure some of the more graphic descriptions are okay at that age.
__label__2 it is what it is: This was what I wanted but not pricey. It is exactly what it looks like in the picture. I just wished I could change the batteries instead of throwing it away when it dies.
__label__2 THE BEST AK ALBUM EVER!!!: This in the strongest, illest album AK has ever dropped. The flow and energy is undeniable.
__label__1 Lots of Plugs: If you enjoy reading novels that plug lots of products and brand names, you will love this novel. The following products and brand names were plugged in this novel: Nike, Saran Wrap, Nextel, Coleman, Four Seasons Hotel, Dilly Bar, Panasonic, Visa, Batman, Cessna, Denny's, Dodge Ram, Texaco, Safeway, Breyers, IGA, Coke, HBO, CNN, Burgar King, Reebok, Citgo, Pepsi-Cola, Junior Mints, Sears, Subaru, Saturn, Cadillac, MG, Chevrolet, Google, Joe Boxers, Motorola, Slurpee, 7-11, Corvette, Twinkies, Altoids, and Doritos. (Not to mention: At least 15 major label recording artists were plugged.)Coleman received the most plugs (I counted 16).Nike was plugged at least 9 times. In my eyes, all these plugs cheapen the novel. I am curious to know how much money SK brought in through these plugs. And does he feel that it was worth it?
__label__1 Dissapointing!!: I bought this CD expecting some decent dance grooves. That was a mistake. There are only two songs on the entire Cd that are worth anything. Most of the songs are just a jumble of vocals and sounds, that lack any build up and have no flow. I can appreciate artistic attempts, but this CD comes across very unrefined, and almost silly. I know that Basement Jaxx has some good sounds, but I think I'll stick to the singles from now on.
__label__2 Fantastic seat: What more can I say that hasn't been said already? This seat is fantastic. We recently moved into an apartment that had some busted looking seats. I ordered two of these to replace the ones in the two bathrooms. Installation couldn't have been simpler. It took me longer to get the old seats off than it did to install the new ones. The instructions were a little small to read, but you really don't even need them. You get the seat, two bolts and two fasteners. You take the seat and make sure the clips are in the unlock position, insert the bolts and lock them in place. Put the seat down with the two bolts going into the holes of the toilet. Hand tighten the fasteners to secure the seat in place, then get a wrench and tighten the bottom of the fastener until the snap off nut come off and there you have it. Took me all of 5 minutes, if that, to install. My wife and I are big people and we have no issues with the seat sliding around or anything like that, it stays put.
__label__2 hard to find item: I could not find this item anywhere locally, and was not sure I would get it in time for Chrismas for my granddaughter, finally located on Amazon and saved Christmas. THANKS
__label__1 Don't pay money for this dud: Disappointing and predictable. Don't waste your money on this. If you must watch it, borrow it from someone or check it out of the library. It actually had the makings of a really good movie, but it falls short on just about every level, and the ending is just stupid. Gosling is okay. Clooney is one dimensional (same vocal inflections and facial expressions he uses in every other movie he's ever been in). Giamatti and Hoffman are good. Marisa Tomei is so-so and not in the movie enough to really matter. The cast was really the only thing the movie had going for it from the beginning, but even all those big names were not enough to save this bomb. Too bad.
__label__1 Doesn't Pour!: I've had this coffeemaker for a couple of years and have spent the whole time looking for another carafe. The one that comes with this machine doesn't pour without dribbling water or coffee everywhere. So every time I fill the reservoir or pour coffee, I end up with liquid all over the counter. I've tried every trick I can think of (pour slowly, pour quickly, pour slowly and first and then faster, etc.), but nothing works. Making the pouring lip deep and wide enough to pour cleanly seems like such a basic of coffee pot design that I can't quite figure out how the Cuisinart designers got this one so badly wrong. But since I can't find a different carafe to fit this machine, I'm finally giving up and buying another coffeemaker. Too bad, because this one is cute and makes decent coffee.
__label__1 misleadinging picture: IT SHOWS THREE(3)ITEMS IN THE ADD ONLY SHIPPED WRIST GUARD VERY MISLEADING WILL BE RETURNED
__label__2 A Double Life: This is the most involved game I've ever seen. You move into your own town (you name it), and begin paying for house... Once you pay for your house, you get to upgrade, and repeat until you have a huge house, with upstairs, and basement. You decorate your home the way you want. Collect furniture, wallpaper, carpets, various types of decorations, and even NINTENDO games. Yes, fully playable nintendo games inside your house! But, you have to get your hands on them first. Visit with the citizens of your town. Mail them gifts, and receive gifts in the mail. Go fishing! There are fishing tournaments! Catch bugs. Dig up fossils to put in your museum. And, there are holidays!This game is real-time. If it is 8:00 a.m. when you stop playing, and you turn it back on 3 hours later, it is 11:00 a.m. when you go back.Link up a gameboy advance, and travel to the island.Get a friend's memory card and visit their town!This game is highly addictive. It'll become your second life.
__label__1 Not quite "everlasting": First of all, let me say that all toys labeled "indestructible" or "everlasting" should be tested on dachshunds! Gave this toy to my dog and watched to see how long it took him to get the treat out. 14 seconds! I thought maybe I didn't have it in correctly, so I tried again later. He got it out even faster the second time because he knew how to do it. He liked the ball though, so I let him continue to play with it. I came back into the room minutes later to find him tearing pieces of rubber off. I will say that the treats themselves take him about 5 minutes to eat, so now I just give him the treats. (I bought quite a few when I bought to ball to save on shipping later) My advice if you are looking for something truly indestructible is to purchase a Kong. No other toy has proven itself against my dog and you can put treats inside.
__label__2 good stuff: I like this product. I had to buy like $2 dental floss though to get free shipping, and save like $8 -- and then they came separately packaged and on separate deliveries! Wish they'd just raise the price $2.
__label__2 Great Product: Fill'er up and light the newspaper at the bottom and 15 min. later the charcoal was ready to go, just one recomendation: place an equal amount of charcoal on your grill before you pour in the lit charcoal, thats if you have a large grill 18" or larger.
__label__1 WHERES THE BEEF?: This book reads like a STAR WARS novel for 15 year olds. Definitly not up to par to the epic mesmerizing sci fi classic.
__label__2 brings back memories: Brings backi memories of when me ans some friends traveled all over SC going todifferent theaters too see the movie
__label__1 Don't buy if you don't have to...: This is probalby one of the worst text book I have ever read. The concepts are extremely difficult to follow most of time there are no consistancy between the concept introduced in the chapter and the the problems presented to you. As one of my friend said: it won't make any difference if they just give us a book full with problems and not teaching us hard to do it. THAT is how bad this book is. Or another suggestion will be buy the book and MAKE SURE you buy the solution manual. Don't worry about reading the book since it won't help you at all, just do the problems with the solution manual and you'll be fine for the semester. At the end of the semester if you are rich enough....bring the book and burn it during one of your camping trip. In case anybody is thinking that I probably failed the class so i hate this book so much, Im actually getting an A and I never read a single page out of this book....again what a useless book.
__label__1 The secret is...: ... that people are willing to spend big bucks for mindless dribble. I am disgusted that I was one of those people. DO NOT MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE. Awful, awful, awful. Seriously, the "secret" is think positive thoughts and good things will come to you. There, I just saved you 24.99 and hours of torture.
__label__1 Incredibly boring, but effective workout: If you can withstand the exceptionally boring presentation and unmotivating banter, then you will get a good workout. The setup is good, where you can choose whether you want to do upper body, lower body or your abs. But that's just the menu. Jackie is sarcastic and not amusing. Her motivation is limited to "you can do anything for a minute" and the guidance on perfect form is minimal in the workout portions. Even her trainers seem like they don't want to be there, so why would I want to do this workout ever again?I used this dvd a few times simply because it was a quick and effective workout, but the mind-numbing aspects have moved it to the bottom of my workout list.
__label__1 not a functional devotional: Why do they keep messing with God Calling??? My old little hard cover (1953)is precious to me; I underline, put in dates relevant to the message and my own Scripture references. This book is meant to put be away with grandma's gilded family Bible. It is a padded hardcover with gold-edged pages; you can't write on the slick pages and if there were any room they fill it with scrolls, curly-q's, added Scripture (don't need that, have my own Bible-several), poetry (??), thoughts to consider (again, I have my own), and then they tell you what to pray. Seriously?? What was simple and sincere, they have made an embellished, pompous and useless book, unless, of course, you want that kind of thing: beauty over function. Certainly not the gift for I intended for a male friend. I don't even want it.
__label__1 Neat Idea, Poor Quality: When I found this clock on Amazon I loved the idea - kind of funky and fun. I thought it would be an interesting touch for my dorm room. However, I was really disappointed when it arrived this week. The entire product is poorly made. I thought it would be a solid piece, but instead it is a piece of metal in the shape of half a box (missing the back and ends). The design is put on like a sticker, which caused a problem particularly with the hand that is a cut out from the picture because part of the sticky side is exposed. It is extremely sticky and catches easily on things. Also, the hands just felt cheap and didn't even line up that nicely. Perhaps with better construction this clock would be a nice item, but it was definitely not worth the $40 I paid for it (shipping is quite pricy seeing as it only cost me about $5 to send it back). If you like interesting clocks, I'd suggest Target; they currently have some really neat ones out for the college rush.
__label__1 Typical white boy pollution: Blues from new york? Uh, you get what you pay for. If you like amature white boy hour then this is the CD for you.
__label__1 get ready for disappointment: wow...all I have to say is wow...what an utter disappointment...I love No Wings to Speak of...I'd even put it in my top ten hardcore albums, I liked the direction of Satalite Years...I love advancement musically, cave-in's jupiter is one of my favorite albums, I love codeseven, and I also like both of their old acts....but this one? I have never heard a more boring, generic, wannabe Midtown sell-out...It's cool if you wanna sing, but please bring the good music with you...the new drummer is even worse than hoobastanks, there are very few "vintage" hopesfall guitar riffs, and vocally, this guy sucks as much as James Hart does as a singer. If you like Hoobastank or Midtown, buy this album, but if you liked hopesfall, be prepared for disappointment...
__label__1 Hated it!: I was absolutely thrilled to learn that a movie was made of this classic- it is one of my favorite Wharton novels. When I read it, it brought me to tears. This DVD also brought me to tears, but for all the wrong reasons! One doesn't relate to Gillian Anderson as the lead- did she read the book? I picked up on a lot of self-pity and suffering but the story wasn't coherent or fluid. Maybe it came out too long for a movie and the plot was lost on the cutting room floor? Because Gillian is wooden, I feel as if everyone else seems awkward and out of place. Maybe it is true, what they say, that the book is always better than the movie? I highly recommend the book.
__label__2 A DEMONSTRATION OF THE ART OF STORY TELLING: Almost everyone is familiar with King Solomon's Mines, She and Alan Quatermain etc but I have encountered relatively few readers of Nada the Lily. This is extraordinary since it is one of Haggard's greatest stories. Given the scenario of an adventure/love story spread out accross the South African landscape during the ruthless and absolute rule of the Zulu king Chaka, this is, as they say, a story that has everything. In this regard I have often wondered that whilst Haggard is one the most filmed if not over filmed authors, Nada the Lily has never made it to the cinema even though it reads as if it was written for the big sreen and the bigger the screen the better.
__label__2 I made me think about thinking: I'm not a linguist or a psychologist and I have to admit that my knowledge in this area of science is pretty limited. I cannot judge Pinker's book on it's content but on how it has helped me in my day to day job. I'm a data architect in an international consulting firm. My day to day work is to translate what the business rules are into data structures that can support the computer systems build around them. My biggest problem has always been translating what am I hearing from the business community into a coherent set of rules that can be implemented using current database technology. Now that I understand a little more on how people think (At least I has been led believe that I got a little smarter after reading this book)and how people communicate what they think my job has become a little easier and more effective.
__label__1 disappointing novel compared to the memorable my antonia: i usually love cather's work (o pioneers & my antonia), but what a disappointment & waste of my weekend. thea, fred and dr. archie somehow lacked the spark that makes characters memorable. the scenes, dialogue & setting of moonstone didn't strike true.
__label__1 Damaged Goods: Received software but my CD rom would not read the disc! I tried it on 2 other systems as well, so I know it was not my system. I e-mailed the seller and go no response! I am currently disputing the charges with American Express. Seller has yet to make good on this purchase.Joe
__label__2 Intriguing Read: I found the questions in this book very insightful and useful in situations where you need to change or continue the conversational thread in a group. Some of the questions are also really good for indirect openers when cold approaching women. With these questions, you open a lot of conversation threads from just one question, leaving you with hours of topics to talk about.On another note, these questions will challenge your morals and values. I enjoy sitting down and thinking about some of the questions proposed in this book. Good way to spend your free time. :)This is a fun book. You'll definitely want to check in out!
__label__2 GOOD: It was a good device did what i needed and im going to keep it for further uses, and it was also helpful with my project.
__label__2 seems to work: I feel I'm gaining more muscle mass after taking this product. I'll keep buying it for now. I also take creatine and glutamine.
__label__1 Cheap and ugly, but functional: This item is for bachelor pads only. It's ugly and cheap. It is of poor quality: it feels flimsy, the foam in the base had to be pushed back in, the threading doesn't feel solid, and the base is not heavy enough. Don't be fooled by the pictures. Even if you got this for free, you would be tempted to throw it away. Not a keeper.
__label__1 Cash? Wow, so unique......: First word of advice, game sucked really bad. Why the hell would you want to play some guy that kills people with gay little hoods......c'mon the storyline totally suxs. Ummm.....what was up with the static clips the whole time... i mean i know the camera is kinda well, yeah filming but this is a game not an old camera, and if it is then that is more of a reson not to buy this game. Everything sucked, camera angles, guns were ok but still, doesnt really make you want to kick sum ass, and well the worst thing that happened to me was that i was on the last level and i needed some help to figure out what i was suppossed to do (I guess it was the special moves) and i started a new game, knowing that my original save would still be there, and guess what happened? ALL my manhunt saves were deleted.Wow! fun game! If you like this to give it 5 stars, you havent played a real video game.
__label__2 DOLPHIN PENDANT: MY WIFE LOVES THE PENDANT AND NOW WEARS IT OFTEN AS SHE CONNECTSWITH MARINE MAMALS AND VOLUNTEERS AT A RECOVERY CENTER
__label__1 Great Concept --- but AWFUL execution!: This book looked like it would really keep my 2-1/2 yr old entertained- especially on car rides. It's a nice solid book with large buttons securely fastened to long colorful ribbons. The first page starts with a brightly colored picture and an indentation to place one button. Each page adds another place for a button - all the way up to page 10 which has a place for all 10 buttons.The saleswoman where I bought it cautioned me that the buttons get tangled, but I didn't think it would be a big deal and bought it anyway. I was so WRONG! Within minutes the ribbons are all wrapped around eachother and the buttons no longer reach where they're supposed to. If you don't mind spending hours untangling cords (or if you have a child who loves to untangle ribbons, yarn, long strings, etc.), then this is a terrific book. But for me, the point of the book was to keep my child occupied without my intervention...and for that purpose, this book failed miserably!
__label__1 The Most Over-rated Trilogy of the Century: After hearing all the hype about the books and the movie, I expected a real classic. However, these books were more like a double dose of NyQuil. I can't believe I wasted 12 hours listening to these. There are far too many characters and the books jump from sub-plot to sub-plot so often that they never established my interest in any one thread. There was no action or suspense. I didn't see the movie but can imagine that it may have been more interesting with the help of the visual effects. This story seems to be perfect for a movie....it needs some kind of help. As it is, it's far from exciting and a "Classic" it's definitely not.
__label__2 The Album Everyone Wishes They Created: I'm going to keep this short and sweet. This is the album that created all the imitators. Every "shoegaze" band want's their sound to be like Loveless. The truth is, they simply cannot. The time, the people, and the idea had to fall into place for this album. There are okay "shoegaze" bands out there but after you listen to Loveless..there isnt a need to listen to anything else. It's the best shoegaze album and the only one really necessary in my opinion. If you don't believe me, listen to "Blown a Wish" and you'll see why this is the best. Great Album.
__label__2 great movie for the family a must for horse lovers: This dvd is loaded with extras. There are mimi games you can play on the tv. If you have a dvd rom on the computer there is even more game and things to do with the kids-like make a calander. I am going to have to upgade my new computer so I can get more out of my dvd. The music and artwork on this film is wodnderful. The movies is not the normal horse talks like a person. The horse is a horse there is a voice now and again you hear sprits thoughts and bran Adams songs/other music tell the story as well. Our familys favoite thing is the learn to draw the spirit and in the movie-my five and nine year old loves the part where every one whats to ride sprit. So buy this dvd and find out who if any one will ride spirit
__label__1 No results!: If you are just trying to lose those extra 5 pounds, this product is not for you. I diligently took it every day for weeks, and NO results. I already work out 5 days a week and watch what I eat. And these pills did not help me get over the final edge.
__label__1 It SUCKS.: My husband ordered this part after much discussion between the seller and himself. My husband was repeatedly reassured this was the right part because both men KNEW that GM had changed the part for this model truck mid-year. Well here we sit with a hundred dollar plus it that we cannot use, Seller sent the wrong part. So, please tell me , what is the proper procedure to follow at this point to get our money back.
__label__1 Junk Chinese Checkers: The cardboard board folds, so does not lie flat. Thought having the lines would help my grandson understand how the checkers have to be moved to play, but so wobbly they just roll off the board. I threw it away. Don't waste your money.
__label__1 Not the same charger: This was not the charger that they had advertised on their page. It was only a few dollars so it wasn't worth my time or effort to return it. They should have advertised it correctly in the first place.
__label__2 Great deal for a new toner cartridge.: I bought this when my printer started telling me the toner was low. It took a couple months before it finally ran out. This cartridge works perfectly in my Samsung ML-2510 printer. I'm very pleased with the cartridge and the price. It's hard to beat the deals at Amazon.com.
__label__1 Not as great...: The speaker barely works once its in the car had to buy a new one because the audio store refused to hook it up bought is as a gift worse one ever
__label__2 Underground hip-hop? very subtle and awesome!: He absolutely dipslays true lyrical talent amongst other talents in this album, slower and some faster style stream of thought lyrics are displayed nicely over inventive beats.This is a great album to own, brings you through some moods that are hard to reconized in most music, But he touches that part of your creative mind and throbs it with such talent and dignity that you will not be dissapointed!It is hip hop, regardless of some of the previous reviews. Very Tastefully done.
__label__2 Hope while growing up gay in alcoholic home: Michael Cart captures well the way an alcoholic parent can shape a child through his teenage years and beyond. His descriptions of protagonist Andy Logan's attempts to manage and cope with his father's drinking problem ring true and avoid sentimental touches. For the most part, he also avoids the fantastical high school love affairs that frequently appear in young adult literature with gay subjects.I enjoyed Cart's direct style very much. My only real complaint is that the story wraps up too quickly near the end, denying the developing character of Billy real complexity. Too many books spawn sequels, in my opinion, but I would love to see an expanded version of this book with Billy more fully developed, and the chance to really see Andy involved in his first relationship of equals.
__label__2 Decent wheels: These wheels are really hard. They are probably 101 duro. I've been skating them for about 3 weeks and they haven't chunked and they have yet to start coning. The hardness of the wheels is great for the skatepark, but if your are strictly a street skater you might want to go with a softer wheel. The neon green is rad too. Chuch
__label__1 Pass This One By: This book is riddled with inaccuracies. Some of the most glaring have been included below:1. John's mother Julia remarried and she abandoned her son and never saw him again.2. Paul was right-handed except when learning guitar because he was a left-handed guitar player.3. George Harrison soon realized that he had no talent for the guitar...it took him years before he could keep up with Lennon and McCartney who were "gifted musically."4. Ringo's first appearance on a Beatles album was on 1966's Revolver. His face was superimposed on that of his predecessor, Pete Best. In late 1965 when Rubber Soul was released, Best asked John Lennon why his [Pete's] nose looked so large.5. George Martin won George Harrison in a poker game because the youngest Beatle played in the Dave Clark 5, another popular British Invasion band.There are more, but you get the general idea. There is no excuse for this kind of thing. Save your money and buy other Beatle biographies instead.
__label__1 Shipped item no where near the photo product description: The plant that arrived was a full 1/3 to 1/4 the size of the plant used in the photo used to market this plant. The photo was the factor used in deciding to purchase from this vendor versus others. I will not likely purchase from this vendor again.
__label__2 Good mouse for a fair price: It is a simple, efficient and reliable device. You don't need more of what it offers for you daily tasks on a computer.
__label__1 Don't believe the amazon hype: I think the bands' immediate family must be writing reviews listed on Amazon. I intended to purchase the latest Modest Mouse CD (a great album and a great band) and got sucked into buying this CD based on an Amazon recommendation. What a mistake. Horrible, derivative, uninspired crap. Really. My big mistake was not listening to the samples available on Amazon. Take if from me--if you listen to a sample--any sample, you will not buy this album. Not going to waste any more time on this mediocre album--just hoping this prevents others from making the same $10 mistake I made.
__label__1 What a disappointment!: I was truly looking forward to this book but what a disappointment! Brock Yates has become a parody of himself. His dialog shifts back and forth from hacknyed fifties slang to current hip phrases like "hooking up". Well known nicknames (such as Eddie Kuzma aka Eddie Kazoom, not Zazoom) are butchered. Yates politics and opinions are freely interchangable as facts. Altogether this "Faction" (his term) is just poor fiction. All of Burt Levy's "The Last Open Road" series are far more illuminating and much more fun.
__label__1 Read for concept - not detail. Code examples are incorrect.: Suggest skipping this title. Many of the examples provided in the book are just plain out of date, using a version of WML that you won't find in any shipping phone. You might also waste time fiddling with the organization of the book.Suggest getting the docs that come with some of the FREE SDKs (e.g. Nokia, etc.), using the source code examples there.If you must read this, get it from the library.
__label__1 sell outs? hmm read this: "The highlight of the evening was actually one of the slower songs, a beautiful rendition of Moonshield from The Jester Race. Rumour has it that this is one of, if not THE last time that In Flames are planning to play this song live, which is a real shame. Especially considering that the same rumour has been circulating about one of the other highlights of the evening, Jotun."thinking of seeing in flames to see/hear some good ole classic songs? that's not happening.RIP , ill miss you guys
__label__1 This book should have been e-published: Dittohead's Guide to Adult Beverages was very boring and unentertaining! It seems as though it was written by an amateur. This book should have been e-published. The author's attempts at wit fall pretty flat. Don't waste your time or money on this.
__label__2 Practical and Modern: We bought this book to help us decipher bathroom quotes that ranged from $6000 to $16000 for the same job. The book allows you to browse or you can step through the chapters to plan your project. For example, I was able to compare shower modules with modern site-built approaches.This is not the typical do-it-yourself, free-at-the-lumber-yard pamphlet information. If you are looking for style ideas don't buy this book. If you want to know what is doable at what difficulty and compare alternative approaches then you want this book.
__label__1 Good comfort but a slight problem....: Okay, first things first. The shoes have excellent comfort on the bottoms of your feet when running. The bad news, because the tongue is so short the edges where the shoelaces lace into end up cutting into your ankles (literally). I wore these shoes and about 10 minutes into my run, my ankles where bleeding. Blood red does not go well with white. I have however rectified a solution to this. You will have to pull out the plastic that holds the shoelaces in(they are blue in color). They are not needed and only cause problems. For me I had only needed to remove the outer plastic, but that might change for someone who is not flatfooted. If you don't like cutting up your shoes, don't buy these.
__label__1 Love the scroll ball, hate the second "button": It's nice to see Apple finally moving toward two-button mice, but this just isn't the answer. Maybe it is just my hands, but I find it impossibly hard to separate the left and right mouse button. More often than not I am right-clicking when I try to left-. It practice it means I keep doing stupid stuff like removing elements from the Safari toolbar when all I want to do is click.Mine is now collecting dust in favor of a traditional two-button mouse.I do, however, really miss the scroll ball. I know many do not, but for me a normal wheel seems hamstrung once you've used the ball on the mighty mouse.
__label__2 A very good anthology , for the AVERAGE fan !!!!!!: I have to start by saying, I HATE hits or anthology CDs...There is always a great song or two missing.This 2 CD set is no exception.Where the hell is A WORLD OF FANTASY? This is huge when you talk TRIUMPH! I bought this set for the better sound quality, the older cds suck.(MASTERING) The TRIUMPH library was REMASTERED in 2004! The quality is even better than this set! As good as the latest Judas Priest,Queensryche,Ozzy-1995,I have the 2004 Never Surrender.I give this set 4 stars, not because A world of Fantasy is missing. But because there is no 5 star hits collection! If you want 5 star TRIUMPH buy their albams,they are well worth it!!!!
__label__1 First Album was better..: Beastie or no Beastie Boys, I was dissapointed when played Vallejo's new album. As compared to their fantastic debut, this album just fails to rock. I can appreciate the approach back to latin roots, but I though this band rocked harder. Totally uninspired. It sounds like DJ Hurricane took the storm out of a firery latino rock band. I still wish to see if they still rock live. I also can't understand why AJ and Alex are posed on the cover the way they are..
__label__2 A modern soundtrack for an old silent film: In the '90s-00s, Blue Dahlia scored two Buster Keaton movies with modern music (some of it old fashioned, of course). I had the benefit of seeing them perform this track live in a local brew pub to accompany "Seven Chances." It was a treat to hear an "arty" band take on a more commercial, though still off-beat, task. Whoever is releasing Keaton's movies nowadays should add this soundtrack as an optional audio channel.
__label__1 Highly Disappointing!: This is simply a genre mystery wrapped in a modern-girl-fiction cover. One dimensional characters and a flat plot line will surely disappoint even those who enjoy "fiction with murder". My suggestion- Don't bother!
__label__2 In her father's eye's she's Miyax, but in others she's Julie: WONDERFUL!!!!!!! You will fall in love with this book, it's got adventure, romance, laughter, and culture! This is not a short book, and I read it in three days!! If that doesn't show you how you get pulled into it, I don't know what does. I think you should absolutely read it!!!!!!!!!a 12 year old in the USA
__label__2 Excellent!!: The product was exactly as described, and it arrived in a timely fation. Thanks it saved me from having to buy a brand new hard copy. It's also a great read!!
__label__2 Awesome Concert, Good CD: This concert is amazing. The CD, however, is just "good." The DVD is much better. In my view, The Who were (and still are) a band that is meant to be seen, not just heard.There are some truly brilliant moments in this show, where each of the band members have their moment to shine. Roger twirls his mic throughout the performance and Pete windmills his way through the roaring set. John Entwistle's bass solo on 5:15 is worth the price of admission alone. Sadly, none of this can be witnessed and appreciated unless you watch the DVD. The audio alone does not do the concert justice.Now, if only there was film footage of the 1970 Leeds show...
__label__1 Do not recommend: I recieved this today and was very disappointed. If you are Michael Jackson fan you probably have most of the footage in other DVD's. The narration did not match the footage, some of it was incorrect. When it was over all I could say was WHAT???
__label__1 This book is very boring .: This book tells that was the family who found this baby. The little baby is with the family for a long time. Until the babys mother comes and takes her away. After a few years the girl and her mother come back to live with the family who found the baby.
__label__2 SWINGLINE STAPLER.: THIS IS A WELL MADE AND STURDY STAPLER (20 PAGES), AGAIN AMAZON CAME THROUGH WITH A TERRIFIC PRODUCT I WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE THAT WANTS A HEAVY DUTY STAPLER. DELIVERY WAS ON TIME AND AS DESCRIBED...
__label__2 So Glad I Read It: My mother forced me to read this book, and I'm so glad she did. This book was great. The meaning of the book goes way beyond the rape trial, so I suggest that if you didn't like it, read it again! It will make more sense. I recommend this book to everyone.
__label__1 A Complete Guide to Boring...: I notice the revered author spent ample amounts of time on kiddie topics. He recommends "shipping a guitar" inside of a case which is inside of a box, packing gently with crumpled paper. Why the explanation? Would I ship a guitar on a damned pallet? Maybe a USPS Flat Rate box? Overall, if you're looking to buy a case or ship a guitar I guess this book is for you. If you care about anything else, you'll be using this to prime your fireplace.
__label__1 really soft: I was excited to make ice cream cones for my grandchildren. I was so disappointed. I need the low fat one so I made the simple vanilla lower fat version. It tasted good, but was soupy. I put the remainder in the freezer, but the whole cool thing was to make the swirl cones for the kids and the machine let me down. Is it the recipes in the book that comes with the maker that fail or the machine? I would appreciate any help anyone has to offer.
__label__1 Not very durable: I was disgusted when this camera stopped working after only 1 week. I bought the A560 to take on vacation, and kept it well-stored in a padded case. With less than 200 shots, the lens cover stopped opening/closing, and then the view screen died. (You could still preview a shot in movie mode, but not in camera mode, and you could still review stored pics - very strange.) The AA batteries tend to last only about 75 pictures, by the way, so keep plenty on hand. I had bought a Canon this time because neither of my Kodaks had held up more than one year, but I returned this and bought a Kodak Z712 instead.
__label__1 forget it, it's not worth it.: It was more like watching a documentary! all these sites and the music, very little talking on the part of the actors. The more annoying thing bout this film was having to watch the cold performance by Cage. Add to that: who on earth have even conceived the thought that all angles live in a library building????? This title is definetly not worth the money or the time.
__label__1 Impossibly depressing and abhorrent!!!!!!!: This is one of the worst books I have ever read. No redeeming value here. Just alot of disturbing and sad things, so sickening that I could not wait to the end. I thought the end would somehow redeem it, but no. It made me sick and sad that an author like this could actually win an award for this piece of trash!!!!!!!!!
__label__1 Martins line: Martin Amis has found the ideal forum to compliment his writing in Tina Browns latest attempt to prove that she has all the literary acumen of a Beverly Hills hair dresser, Talk magazine. Lets just hope for the sake of good writing that Suicide runs in Mr. Amis's family.
__label__2 very practical: What a great, practical book for anyone and everyone looking to get sugar out of their lives.
__label__1 The right title for this film...: Because no one in it seems to know bleep!A horrible waste of time that will have you saying, "there's 2 hours of my life I'll never get back".Ramtha is particularily disgusting. Maybe she can't see how dumb and ugly she is. Maybe someone should tell her so she can see it. Maybe a Peruvian that's never seen a ship could tell her! Of course, at first they would just think she was a beached whale already too far gone to save, because they'd never seen anyone so dead looking. You could make a film about this scenario and it would be infinitely more interesting than WTBDWK.At least "The Secret" (which is barely better) can pass for pop metaphysics. This is so bad it doesn't even qualify for as a gift for your worst enemy. Er, on second thought...
__label__1 Caution!: I was quite disappointed by this book, full with bad examples, the girl steals, lies several times, is cruel with her mother and mistreats her brothers with no consequences to all this behavior. Then you have the birds that in the book are told to be the souls from deaths, are we talking about reincarnation? or they are simply demons? for sure there is nothing Christian about this. And is also quite sad, so this book needs a lot of guidance from parents.
__label__1 Tub is too bulky - takes up half of the bathroom!: I bought this tub because it received really good reviews - but it is gigantic and really takes up half of my bathroom.Also, because of it's size you don't transport it and end up keeping it in the bathtub anyway!I found it's just easier for my daughter to take a bath with me!
__label__2 keeps feet comfortable in all work environments: When I started the new job in an industrial type job and was required to wear steel toed shoes I immediately bought a pair of heavy, leather, steel-toed boots. I found out quick that they did nothing but cause me pain and blisters. Found these xx wide, light weight steel-toes online through Amazon and it's the best work shoe anyone could ask for in any industrial work environment.
__label__2 i wish i was there: i had this show on video and I watched it so many times i just cant get enough you have to see it !!! If I could be in one gig only through all history I would be in this one .Ian the drummer plays like there's no tommorow {I dont know what kind of a drug these guys just took ,but it works good}I gave it 4 stars because the sound on the cd is not that good, it's better to buy the video
__label__1 Not entirely terrible: This book makes me sad - it could actually have been any good, if Basu had had a good editor. There are some promising ideas and some promising writing. There is, however, a whole lot of trite cliches and blantant copying of other authors ideas. Those last are among the most cringeworthy aspects of the book: they appear without rhyme or reasons as standalone paragraphs, don't fit into the universe and make one doubt the judgement of the writer.Stay away, I wish I had.
__label__2 travel shaver: I BOUGHT THIS RAZOR FOR MY HUSBAND AND HE LIKES IT.HE SAID IT IS GOOD FOR A QUICK TOUCH UP
__label__1 One Star: The storyline is just so unbelievable and makes no sense. None of the charactors are fleshed out enough for to remember who each one is. The names don't help either. Nora Roberts charges on with the story without explaining anything like the whos, the whys and the hows. I gave up on the story half way through the story and I doubt I'll bother with reading the other two in the trilogy.
__label__2 Good Gate, but some minor faults: This gate is exactly what it says, a wider than average gate. Works as expected. I only with the retaining clips on the top and bottom are very weak. But, for the price it is exactly what you expect.
__label__1 Left / Right signal reversal: The preservation of the correct left / right accuracy is non existent. I bought two of these and even they were not the same. The left channel was incorrectly crossed over to the right channel.
__label__2 This was an excellent single!!!: This CD was the first single I ever bought and is absolutly awesome! Since this song hasn't been released in the US, it is a fun new song to learn the lyrics to. I learned them in one day. And Chris looks so hot on the cover!
__label__2 A Definite Keeper: I have owned The Truth Is for a few years now. Every time I listen to it, I am impressed once again by the sensitivity and gentelness of the songs. This is so rare in gay themed music. My favorites are I Confess, The Two Cowboy Waltz, and One Less Dancer. They deal with the universal themes of love and loss - themes that define the lives of so many of us. In addition to the beautiful songs, Mark's voice is warm and soothing. The instrumentals are simple and appropriate.I highly recommend this CD to anyone who enjoys the softer side of gay music.
__label__1 The best worse zombie movie of recent memory..: Even the most desperate of zombie fans will find this absurd. I mean jeez, a young girl living in the woods with her zombie parents? No, this isn't a comedy. A journalist runs into a local man in a town that she seeks a story. He tells two bogus tales of terror. A man does exercise for 15 minutes in the first story. BORING. The sound, editing, acting, and over all product is BAD. I am a big fan of gore and bloody zombie effects. This had nothing to offer me. I doubt you'll find anyhing for yourself either.
__label__1 not what i expected: i got this cd, thinking it would be more like his newer (old) reggae, and to me, it totally wasn't. I don't like this cd at all, and i'm going to re-sell it.
__label__1 Don't be fooled like I was: I too thought this was a Cirque Du Soleil performance.....major disappointment!! This is nothing but aboring hum-drum movie not even worthy of the Cirque Du Soleilname!!
__label__2 The Price is Right: The quality is not that great but coming from the 80's I don't expect much more. I'd have loved to get a much better package with chapter descriptions and other info but I still gave it 4 stars because of the price. I'm not sure I'd have paid more for a better packaging on this particular show. Bottom line I'm happy with the product and price.
__label__2 gift: This was a gift for my brother and it brings back memories from days gone by. Cute dvd to watch
__label__1 I want two hours of my life back!: This is one of the worst movies I have ever had the misfortune to watch. I would have walked out of the movie house, but I kept thinking, it had to get better. It didn't. The only thing this movie is good for, is a sleep tonic. If you suffer from insomnia, put it in the vcr and you will be out in 10 minutes. Boring, Boring, Boring.
__label__2 This is not rocket science: I was sick of getting shattered ice and just wanted something that would give regular full cubes. This always gives full cubes. Awesome? I would say works as designed.
__label__2 Coleman skillet: Very pleased w/product !! Exactly what was wanted for XMAS "gift", thanks.Good seller, shipper, etc.
__label__1 Not the right aerator for Carolina Clay, and Missing Pieces: Ordered this to tow behind my riding mower and was disappointed on two major counts:1) Missing parts and stripped bolts. Proper assembly could not be fully completed due to a missing hitch plate and a poorly threaded bolt that could not be used. I managed to improvise, but sending the correct parts and a couple of extra nuts and bolts should be a minimum requirement.2) I live in the Carolinas and the soil is too hard for this aerator. I added over 50 pounds of weight to the top of it but had minimal ground penetration. It might work on softer soil, but doesn't do much for Carolina clay.
__label__1 Disappointing: I was very disappointed in this game. The only thing to do is constantly beat up on bad guys... there's no plot, other than being locked into the movie plot, and the gameplay is monotonous and extremely unoriginal. You can't even make use of the environment around you. You're locked into moving through the game in exactly one way, with no interaction with other characters.Further, the camera angles are extremely frustrating and make gameplay difficult in many instances, especially if you're using a bow. There is virtually no aiming with the bow... either you're pointed roughly in the right direction and you hit things or you're not and your arrows fly off to nowhere.The Lord of the Rings setting doesn't redeem this at all. I loved the movies and I love the books, but this game is missing everything that makes them great.Now to figure out how/where to sell my copy...
__label__1 Need to Know Your Crowd: We played this with some out of town visitors and I didn't rank it very high. I was sort of disappointed. I think I would have liked it better if you could fill in your answer like on the Newlywed game instead of being stuck with their list. Too often it was too simplistic (teenager is a sports car!, Mom likes chocolate!) or no answers were close. But after reading other reviews, I see that the people who love the game were playing with people in their households who really know each other. We were playing with children from out of town too. I'll try it again, but I think the key is to play with your close friends and family. It definitely leads to lots of discussion.
__label__1 2 Stars For Effort: I gave this movie 2 stars for effort. I took my younger cousin to see this movie when she was in town...needless to say, I was highly disappointed in it. I did laugh on some parts. I don't even know how the movie ended because I fell asleep towards the end...or at least I think it was the end lol. The idea for it was awesome for a movie idea, but when Tyler put it together, it didn't come together brilliantly like the idea...just saying. To each its own though...the guy that worked at the movie theater gave rave reviews about it, even said he saw it twice...but when I got in there...definitely a thumbs down. You missed it this time Tyler.
__label__1 condition of doll: Nothing wrong with the doll. Since we collect these Holiday Barbie dolls, we were disappointed that the case was cracked. Seller did not disclose this in the description.
__label__2 THE HORSE PACKER'S BIBLE: The old clichéd saying, "A Picture is worth a Thousand Words!" is very true, especially when considering such things as knots, hitches and lashings. And the saying certainly holds for HORSE PACKING IN PICTURES by Francis W. Davis. This book, written over thirty years ago, continues to be the standard when it comes to learning the ropes (and, yes, that pun was entirely intended!) about horse packing and the mechanics of making it effectively and easily happen. Handsomely illustrated, HORSE PACKING... will become your bible for getting from here to there with your packhorse in tow. From getting started, to choosing the right pack animal, to making your own packing gear, HORSE PACKING... is the book you need.UPDATE JULY 2012: My original review mentioned that this book was out-of-print and hard to find. I just received word that this sensational book is back in print! For those who have not been able to find it in the past, here's your chance!THE HORSEMAN
__label__1 truth in advertising: I was told I would get the cd rom that comes with this book and I didn't get it. Two weeks ago I gave Katie Verhalen the opportunity to fix this problem by emailing her through this site, I got no response. I'm still waiting for what was promised: The cd that goes with the book!
__label__2 A literary accomplishment that deserves recognition.: This book held a magnetic attraction to me because in it I found a variety of characters that touched my heart. The story is rich with "socially redeeming value". If you devote some time to it, it can help you be more aware of how different individuals respond to problems and situations that have captivated their lives. The writer provides you with vivid description and has devised means to help you walk with those who are suffering problematic situations including the plight of being a male or female unwed parent, surviving a natural disaster, living with mental health problems, being an aging male or female searching for happiness and many other situations that combine to portray humanity in the variety of cycles of living. The book takes a look at prejudice contrasted with genuine love. I highly recommend this book and could see it being reviewed in college classes who are studying authors who are new on the scene
__label__1 Displeased: This edition shows no table of content when viewed in a Kindle "Fire". Have not yet tried on Kindle for iPad or on my phone. Collections without a ToC are nearly worthless.
__label__2 I like it, but I thought it would be thicker.: I mix this with shea butter and apply to my hair, but I thought it would be thicker.
__label__2 Poison Still rocks: This album has all the rocking hits Poison is famous for. It's good and you will enjoy it.
__label__2 Very nice and convenient for a portable antena: It's a good little unit. But remember it's only a portable and will just improve reception so much. I do recommend it for its quality and portability.
__label__2 Best driving scenes ever.: The driving scenes are absolutely brilliant. The director's commentary on the DVD is very informative. It turns out there's a reason the driving looks so good....
__label__1 Concerned Benoit Fan: Here's a Message I found on David Benoit's Website: "At the request of Mr.Benoit, "Lost & Found" (1994) is not listed as part of his discography. This album is an unauthorized release which Mr.Benoit was neither notified of nor compensated for. Please do not support the dishonest means by which this album came about."
__label__1 Not what I expected: It wasn't what I expected when I got this movie on Blu Ray. Because of the fact that there's lots of greenery in this movie, it doesn't mesh very well. Case in point would be the ravine where they were chasing Rambo with the helicopter. The brush was literally blurred as the camera panned thru the valley. Most of the action as the sheriff posse ran thru the forest was blurred also. Yes, my motion settings were set just fine. In fact, I tried adjusting it on the fly and it didn't help. My other Blu Ray's look really good. This one did not... which is disappointing because this was a great movie.
__label__1 VIZIO 50" plasma tv is BAD: I bought ours from Sam's Club after a week of comparitive shopping, and wish I had not seen it. We had it three years when the power supply went out, and after a three month wait on the part and $458 in repairs, we only had it two more months before it went out again, this time some circuit boards with a repair cost of over $700 for parts alone. Gave up on it and bought a different brand.
__label__1 Made my boobies itch like crazy: I hated these pads and had to return them. They made my boobies itch like crazy and the adhesive would never keep the pad in place. I found myself adjusting them several times an hour as they shifted around. I like the Medela washable cotton pads much better. They are a little more expensive but are reusable. They don't make my boobies itch either!
__label__1 Failed after 2 years: Looks like I should have read the other reviews before purchase. It broke after 2 years and looks like from other reviewers if I don't register within 30 days then they don't honor the 3 years warranty. Oh well, I was giving this product a chance, going back to APC.
__label__2 Bugdom: Well, I couldn't get it going -- I have a very large brand new Mac -- and I was going to be able to get it and then send it over to my older Mac, but it didn't work -- I might be able to fix it soon. I hope -- This Bugdom is very sweet and fun.
__label__1 Henckels International Everedge 13-Piece Knife Set: Don't let the brand name fool you. This is a really cheap set of knives and I am shocked that Henckels would even put their name on it. The blades are thin and the handles are poor as well. Seems like the kind of knives you'd buy in a pinch at the supermarket. It may seem like a great deal, but it really isn't when you have to trash it and buy a better set.
__label__2 Nice book and nice size: I ordered this for a grandchild who loves horses. She is a little young for the age suggestion in the book, however, she will love the pictures.
__label__1 Did not stick!!!: Usually this kind of tape is so sticky that it is a bit bothersome, but at least it does the job and all is forgiven.Indeed I was, and am, shocked to find this tape simply does not stick. I agree with another reviewer that perhaps this is a bad batch, but how many bad batches can there be?This tape does not stick and cannot be used to seal packages. It is quite annoying to have to order a six-pack of these things and find I have wasted time and money.Just today I bought a cheap 7-11 "brand" of this packing tape and found it sticks better than the Scotch brand.
__label__2 Entertaining: This movie isn't award-winning, but it's entertaining and a good flick for popcorn and a movie on the couch. I recommend it for an evening when you don't want to do a lot of thinking!
__label__2 Wow! Powerful struggle of every challenged person.: Brings into focus the difficulty of enjoying life with dignity beyond the limits others place for them. Carter was believable every step of the way. She blew me away with her performance. The nuances and the broad strokes blended to present a stunning view of someone facing her challenges. Do not dismiss as just another tear jerker or chick flick. A lesson learned for everyone.
__label__2 wind pants: Look good and fit OK; very comfortable; met all expectations except rear pocket zipper broke almost immediately. Would still buy them again.
__label__1 not enough: Book was misleadingI was mislead into thinking there were more then 1 recipe for bath bombs. There was only 1
__label__1 Cheap and not worth the money!: This book is confusing and cheap. Buy another book to supplement! The organization of this book was difficult for me to follow. Good luck to anyone who's professor uses the textbook. It could just be my learning style but I struggled to learn from this text book and my professor who required the book.
__label__1 Corey Feldman in underaged sex movie: A glorified Corey Feldman playing a 25 year old coke snorter screwing 15 and 16 year old high schoolers. Cory is one year younger than me in real life, He seriously has issues signing up to do this movie. Im all for movies like american pie, fast times even porky's but geeez this is way over the line. Very disappointed with the movie, cory and netflix for pushing it out there.
__label__1 Stopped working after 6 weeks....: Like other customers who rated this item low, my baby has been using this swing for only 6 weeks and it no longer works either!! The music started skipping like a broken record last week, and now the swing no longer swings and the motor just makes a loud clicking sound. I think the problems started when the blanket I had covering her in the swing was dragging the floor and slowing down the swing. That happened several times (I didn't think it would break the swing) and shortly after is when the music started skipping and now the swing won't even work at all. So if you use a blanket, don't let it drag! Anyway, when this swing WAS working, my baby loved it! She would fall asleep a lot in it. Fisher Price is sending me a new motor that should be here in 7-10 days. I hope this new motor works but it sounds like from other customer reviews, the new motor didn't work either after a while.
__label__1 Phallic Narcissism at it's finest....: Gary Schwartz writes like a classic Phallic Narcissist, a clinical term used to describe people who elicit his type of behavior.Isn't it curious how he espouses over and over again being a "clinical psychologist", when in fact it is a LIE. Anyone who would lie about their credentials, would lie about their results in research....don't believe the hype.....
__label__1 Failed within a Year: This item worked well for the first few months then recently became very unreliable. My connections were dropped more and more frequently until eventually, even power resets failed to reconnect it.
__label__2 klein crimping pliers: these are a great tool for my shop. we have 5 guys that use them all day long.much better than any other brand
__label__1 Boring!!: I barely got through this book. In fact, I skipped through about 3/4 of it. I read romance books for ROMANCE! This book went on and on (endlessly) about the character's trek and adventure, and there was very little romance until almost the end of the book. This should be under the "Adventure" category - not romance.
__label__1 PC to TV Converter: I purchased this product for presenting. Even if you unplug your monitor, and hook this up instead, you will get the most pitiful picture you have seen in your life. It is in black and white and it splits your screen in half and it goes up and down across your screen in a fast motion. Save yourself the time and agravation and DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT! It is the worst thing I have bought in my life.
__label__1 Dissapointed: This is the SAME game as FFX (The previous version). ALL the maps are the same and all the world map is basicly a rip off of the old game with chicks wearing funky clothes. Where is what's his face? Anyway, The cool thing is the battle mode fights are MUCH faster and you can control the speed. There are many cool costume changes and junk. All in all, This game SUCKS! Don't BUY it. Unless of course you a die hard fan, then maybe you like wasting your life in front of it. I give this game 1 star only because the disk would NEVER read and I kept getting errors. It's BRAND NEW and it doesnt work? I think it's my system is messed up more than the NEW game. Thanks Amazon.
__label__2 Speaks to hearts and minds: Halo Repair is a warm, wise and gently humorous collection of stories written from the stuff of everyday life by a man whom you like from the first page. Bill Fiest offers a practical guide about discovering God in the midst of the ordinary and growing in faith. It is a joy to read and a comfort to reread.
__label__1 more jump on the Columbine $$ bandwagon: How do you rate a book that is based totally on lies? Christian "Faith" had absolutely nothing to do with the events of Columbine. It happened because two boys who had been ridiculed and picked on for years finally snapped. Christians were not targeted, blacks were not targeted. It's despicable that these people continue to put out these books that are nothing but lies.
__label__1 Lots of synthesized power ballads, not much Chicago: This album is largely a collection of highly produced, heavily synthesized power ballads, which had become Chicago's "sound" in the 80's. The difference between 21 and other albums from this era is that the core character of Chicago is, to my ears, almost non-existent here. This album could have come from any number of bands/singers/producers. Another reviewer said that 21 does not hide the horns behind synthesizers - well, we must be listening to different albums. The horns are mostly buried in the mix, or are doubled by synthesizers. Based on the many positive reviews, this sound is just fine for many listeners. But if you're expecting to put on this CD and recognize it as a Chicago album, you may be disappointed. If you're looking for recent recordings (i.e. Bill Champlin/Jason Scheff era) that really sound like Chicago, check out Night and Day or Chicago XXV (Christmas).
__label__1 Don't waste your time: It just isn't worth it. This is one of those books that gets a lot of press about being dangerous when really, it is only dangerous to the person who buys it and tries these things.Also, in today's world, more thorough and useful information is available off of the internet.
__label__1 Not worth it: This ink came in as 21b.....not 21. The prints are a bit fuzzy and not very dark. There is a big difference in the quality in the 21 ink you get at Walmart and this 21b ink. I would not recommend and would not buy again.
__label__1 did not buy this item, do not know why it is in my review list: did not buy this item, do not know why it is in my review list
__label__1 This band has the most "greatest hits" cd's in history: This is getting crazy...How about some new stuff?
__label__1 Written for a 12 yr old video gaming audience: I don't think I've been more bored by any other book (Except perhaps Anna Karenina). But at least Anna Karenina was well written. This book is not.
__label__2 This is the islands, no matter where you happen to be...: What a great intro to slack key from Keola Beamer. The material presented herein should not present any problems for a lower intermediate fingerstylist. Anyone who has played country blues or other fingerstyle arrangements will be able to work through these tunes without much trouble. However, at some point during the lessson it just might dawn upon you just what great music this is. While the essence of slack key is the tuning and the style of play, in the end it's the beautiful music that is the reward. The notation and tablature are accurate and the selection showcases several popular tunings for modern Hawaiian slack key music. Add Beamer's DVD "The Art of Hawaiian Slack Key Guitar" (Homespun Tapes) and you'll be well on your way to the Aloha spirit.
__label__1 Not the same as the console verisons: Hello I am 11 years old. I bought this game last christmas eve becasue I saw commercials of the video game and decided to get the PC verison. I thought the game would be the same as console versions and the movie. When I played it on Christmas morning, I was dead wrong. There is no battle and driving levels in the game. Spongebob does not act heroic in the game. He just acts like a little baby. Don't buy this pile of sh**. Buy the Gamecube,PS2, and Xbox versions. This game sucks badly.
__label__2 Good....but not Great: Good is good enough. I passed the 70-270 exam on the first try after reading this book and taking practice exams from two major exam prep testing software packages. Still, the exam is wicked hard.
__label__2 Bring That "Grime" Music To The U.S.: Second time around, Dizzee Rascal's new album "Showtime" is much more exclusive than his first. He is a different rapper than what we hear in the states, trust me. I can't help but get heavy into the beats (it's bananas~in a good way). He is to the point, having nothing to hide, and nothing to be phony about. Coming from the South side of London, Dizzee is street. "Dream" is one track that you can sit back and laugh to, because you'd never suspect an artist to put that type of music as the background and with his lyrics, he makes the track "hot". I've always been a fan of garage music and trip-hop but he is one that is making me love it much more. Overall this CD will make him much more popular in the states. If you check out Vibe, Source, Blender, and Source, they all give Dizzee Rascals great reviews. Definetely worth owning!!!
__label__2 This Camera Has Seved Me Well: I got this camera for Christmas several years ago (2001). It was a decent camera during its time. The battery life is non-existant. I used to spend a fortune on batteries. The memory card included allows you to take 12 pictures of highest resolution. The camera is huge, so it is hard to transport in pockets. When it focuses and adjusts to the light levels, etc., it makes an awful noise. The delay with the shutter did create some portraits of hilarity though as the people posing thought the picture was taken and it catches them between a smile and a straight face. It was a nice camera to have as a high school student, but after graduating from college, it is severely inadequate.
__label__2 Very interesting and different!!: This was a fun, interesting read. Very different and enjoyable. The book went very quick and was a good story. The author showed different perspectives and brought me into how they thought. Definitely enjoyed this!!
__label__1 I Already Knew the story: I have to admit, I usually do not like historical fiction...this book was no exception. I read half, and read the end because it was boring.....
__label__1 Not a good value: With shipping & tax, this purchase topped out over $30. I assumed it would be a full size version of the powder tin as you would see in the stores - it isn't. It is like a little tester version, maybe 1/3 the size I was expecting - steer clear, this product can't sell on the counter at the price they charge, so they are selling it over the web...
__label__2 Appearences aren't Everything....: Aside from the fact that Manson is visually repulsive, and his messages are taken to heart by millions of angst ridden adolescents the album is great. I have always been a fan of heavy music, and heavy this is. For those of you that scoff at Manson, this ablum stands up on it's own. I am sure that much of the credit is due Reznor, but nonetheless it's a great listen.
__label__1 No Control over Steam Settings, Gunky Water Tank: While the water in this steamer heats up very quickly, there is no control over the steam settings. Be careful and don't leave this appliance unattended as the water will soon boil off. While initially the quick heating seemed to be a big plus, I realized that the lack of control settings (i.e. high, medium, low) was a minus. An even bigger minus was the fact that the way the water tank is designed (a plastic tab inside the tank obstructs ventilation), it never dries out completely. Also after one use, there was some sort of gunky white stuff on the bottom of the water tank. Tried the vinegar rinse, but the gunky stuff remained. In short, this appliance lacks control settings and it needs a redesign to allow for better drying between uses.
__label__2 SanDisK Cruzer 4GB: Great price, and plenty of memory for my needs. Only thing that I don't like is the U3 software that tries to launch every time I plug it in. I was able to disable the auto start feature, but it still opens up an extra additional drive. Minor irritation at best. I use this flash drive to move files back and forth from various lap tops to our network for back up and storage. I also use it to store personal e-mail that would otherwise eat up a lot of memory on my network account. 4GB is plenty for me, and for less than $30 you can't hardly beat it.
__label__2 Really loved this book.: Read it twice in Paperback, which I purchased twice because I lost my first copy and now I'm going to get it in hardback to add to my collection.Great book, funny, heart wrenching and believable (as much as a romance novel can be). I personally think it's a great read, characters have depth and you can feel the love they have for each other.
__label__2 Chakra-liscious: I just received my DVD on Saturday and did it this past weekend and absolutely loved it!!!!! I have tried yoga and haven't gotten into it, however this DVD is totally fun and keeps you moving and you can actually feel it working. Five stars and two thumbs up!!!!!!!
__label__1 Christmas Movie: VHS tape was marked on and dirty. Even tho it said delivery date could be as late as Dec. 30th, I ordered this Christmas tape for gift on Dec. 7th and don't see why it had to arrive the week after Christmas. Was not satisfied with this buyer and will not purchase from them in the future.
__label__2 Good start to the 90s: In 1989 Aerosmith released another masterpiece, "Pump". Now they went back into the studio and recorded "Get A Grip" in 1993. Steven Tyler and Joe Perry did it again. Songs like "Eat the Rich", "Fever", "Livin' On the Edge", and the famous ballad "Amazin'" made the album a blast. Plus Joe Perry on lead vocals on "Walk On Down". Buy this album.
__label__1 Stopped Working After 3 Months: My son enjoyed this camera while it lasted, but after 3 months the camera "froze". The screen was on and none of the buttons worked anymore. The only way to turn it off was to remove the batteries.I expected more because of the amount of money I spent!
__label__2 hi def nostalgia: a long time favorite and key film from my youth based on a story by a key writer from my youth. transfer is great, could be better but won't complain. just glad it's made it to blu!
__label__2 comfy: I do like these shoes, i mean sandals :) I read prior that they ran big, so I bought a smaller size. I normally wear a size 6, so I bought a size 5. I wish I would have went for size 6 because they are quite snug. I am sure I can stretch them out tho. I do enjoy wearing these shoes, they are very stylish...I also have to say they aren't really creame, they are a bit more darker, in the picture they appear very soft thick clothe like, but they are thin clothe. I do like them tho :)
__label__1 Order the bigger one: Cats were fascinated initially but it was too easy to reach their toys. Order the bigger one - cats need a challenge.
__label__2 Lego star wars: this game is really fun! I enjoyed the game even after 6weeks of playing. being a jedi is really fun because you can use the lightsaber, the force, and do a double jump! It's also fun to be a blaster character and shoot at random. One really cool thing is that if you are grievous's bodyguard and you get one heart left, your head falls of. Another cool thing is when the CPU is C3PO, because then if he gets hurt once, he loses an arm. twice, he loses his other arm, and three times, he loses one of his legs and starts hopping around. The cut scenes in this game are hilarious. it plays back scenes from star wars and ads humor to them.THIS GAME IS AWESOME!!!
__label__2 Great Card, Simple Installation: This is a high-performance networking card that is extremely easy to install. Bear in mind that Windows does not have the driver needed to use the card already, so you have to insert the CD that comes with it. That's as difficult as it is, so long as you don't mind cracking open your case to install it in an empty PCI slot.*** Update - I'm up to having five of these guys, and love them. The price is great, the installation is a breeze, and they have worked flawlessly for me. Every computer in my house has one in it now.
__label__2 The man writes from his heart.: I finished the book and thought it was a useful book. I'm also reading his other books. Wish these were the books my high school made me read. It was absolutely meaningless and a waste of my time that my high school teacher forced me to read books such as Shakespeare.
__label__1 GTA VCS: I had a problem receiving the game from Amazon. They delayed 1 day because UPS had problems identifing the adress! I think Amazon should review the way the summarize the adress.The game itself is not bad, but not worth the price! The first version GTA liberty city was great.
__label__2 The book was kind of confusing, but the idea was great.: It took me a little while to get into the story and get to know all the characters, but once I did I couldn't put the book down. Charles Dickens is a wonderful writer, and Great Expectations prooved it.
__label__2 Good book, but not an easy read: This book is another of the classic written by German Generals after the war. If you are looking for a good accont of tactics, and how the German army fought, this is another great book.There are a few small errors in the authors memory, but that can be excused, as there are mistakes in all after the fact accounts of the war. They do not take away from the book.The only thing I did not like about the book was that it was not easy to read. It took me over a month to read the first half of the book covering the war up through North Africa. Once I got to the second half of the book dealing with Russia I finnished the book in three days. I admit a bias to an interest in the eastern front, but for some reason the first half of the book was painfully dull even if it was informative.Ad this book to your list with Von Luck, Guderian, and Manstein.
__label__1 I prefer Seamonkeys: I bought this triops kit with a seamonkeys kit, and I have to say I enjoyed the seamonkeys more. Triops are much harder to raise and everything has to be perfect for them to hatch. However, seamonkeys are incredibly easy to raise and require less effort. I'm not going to bash on the triops because I never got them to hatch so I don't know how fun they are. However, I would like to say that triops and little kids won't be a good combination because they require a lot of work to hatch and raise.Also, I'm not too sure about the directions provided with this kit to raise triops because I found conflicting directions online which I heard yields better results. Overrall, this kit didn't work for me and I followed the directions exactly as they were in the kit therefore I'm not too happy with my purchase. I would recommend anyone who decides to buy this to find and follow directions that are online and ignore the ones that are in the kit.
__label__2 Very cool and usefull product: Idea is great, very cool once you get it working. It does require a hard wire network connection. It should be more explicit in the product description that you need to purchase extra equipment if you want to hook it up wirelessly, and of course that brings its own share of complexities.The software for the product is evolving and becoming better and better every day.
__label__2 Sad story: This is a very emotional book as the reality of A.J's short life is revealed. There were so many witnesses to A.J's abuse, and the step mother barly took means to hide her hatred towards A.J. And this happened in 1993....shocking. All I can say is that I wish A.J was my beautiful son.
__label__2 Grizzly Man Review - A Tale of the Man absorbed with Bears: An absolutely stunning documentary that looks at one man's fasicination with Grizzly Bears in Alaska. The shots of the bears and the scenery in Alaska alone makes this documentary a "must-see". The story of one mans obsession with "saving the bears" is a bit too much at times and is a lesson to any of us who have ever let one thing take control of our lives. And haven't we all? This film is well-produced, unique and artistic from interview with the director to the music to the raw footage of bears and Alaska. This movie is worth watching and worth owning.
__label__1 Shame on you Mr. Dickerson: I was really disappointed. A lot of the book is based on speculation about her background and no one knows for sure what is fact and what is fiction. The author seems to have some sort of obsession with the young lady and her sexuality and her apparent envy of another child star Britney Spears because she (Britney) became famous before her. He gives absolutely no evidence for his reasoning and it reads like a tabloid magazine, and really it's quite creepy that a grown man would dwell on it so much. He goes on to say more than once what a noble thing it has been that he has waited so long to reveal her real name, that by not doing so would go against freedom of the press, yet it's confusing to the reader because he apparently has only been aware of her for a couple of years. I literally feel guilty and sick for buying this book and supporting this guy. It's highly disrespectful to both Natalie Portman and her family.Shame on you, Mr. Dickerson. Shame on you!
__label__1 product defect: dvd appeared to be in good shape wien it arrived. we played it a few days ago and everything was fine for approx 70% of the movie. it then atarted stopping and blurring and getting out of focus. i played another movie later and had no problem. would like to get a different one if possible.
__label__1 Big disapointment!!: Bought this machine for my daughter as a Christmas present-couldnt wait to use it after reading many reviews. The machine itself looks great. My daughter and I were very excited to use it, but very dissapointed in what it produced. I was aware of the amount of time it needed to heat up, but even after heating we only got a very tiny ball of candy on our cone, we decided to try again since the small amount tasted very good and she was very excited, but the second cone was even smaller and the amount of sugar was really building up on the bowl. We wiped off all the sugar from the side and gave it another try which only produced another small ball of candy-not even enough to share-and before all the sugar was even spun we could smell it starting to burn! We shut it off and had to let it cool for about 1/2 hour before we could clean it all up-let it dry only to try again the next day with the same results. Very disapointed!!!
__label__2 This Game Kicks ***!: YOU HAVE TO BUY THIS GAME!Theres tons of great graphics, tons of disney characters and Final Fantasy that you can relate to. Plus, there's lots of great side missions, bonus items, and more! The battles are incredibly colorful, there are all sorts of different spells to cast and has a huge variety of personal upgrades. Great rpg game, I hope that they come out with the sequel.
__label__1 One of The Most Over-rated book of DP's!: I've read almost all of DP's books, too, & I've got to say that this is 1 of the only 2 of hers that I neither bothered to read the middle nor the ending of! Completely uninteresting & non-gripping emotionally! Don't be fooled by the earlier reviewer's raves -- I only paid $2.99 on eBay to get this, & yet, I've regretted spending even those few dollars! This one's completely unworthy of anyone's time or money in my opinion.... Lynne Graham's THE SCILLIAN'S MISTRESS has a sort of a similar storyline, but by far, far, far more interesting!!! Get that one through eHarlequin instead of this one if U wish for an interesting, emotionally gripping romance novel -- U won't be sorry with that one, I promise!
__label__2 Sexy woman - Nice voice: Well first of all she is extremely sexy. Her voice sounds pure and young, a lot like Shanice. I would love to see her work with some more r&b flavored producers because she definitely have a great voice. The cd has a pop feel to it. I was hoping for more R&B flava. I liked the songs Supernatural & Things that we all do for love (slow jam). She could go far with the right songs. Love you Nona. Looking forward to the next one.
__label__2 I miss Harvey: I first heard this while at a public radio station in Alaska. I hadn't heard from Harvey Mandel in years and I was happy to see he still had it. I hope your doing well in Crested Butte, Harvey. I guess you've gone back to the blues like all the old dudes do. I'll miss your unique fusion of rock, blues and jazz.
__label__1 Absolutely horrid: As others have said, the worst DVD I've seen. Not only were the transfers done from what appear to be film that was played so much it was scratched and broken, the audio is terrible. On Chinese Connection, it's too slow (makes everyone sound like a dying record player). Madacy is off the list; I sent them email to complain and never heard a word back. The CASE is worth more than this sorry disc!
__label__1 Disappointment from Bruce: This song attempts to capitalize on the wave of patriotism sweeping the country (another one; groan) but fails with this collection of forgettable tunes. Unlike previous albums such as "Born in the USA", this work has no memorable tunes that fans will tap their toes to and sing along with. A big disappointment.
__label__2 Perfect!: Easy to assemble and works well to organize toys. It didn't take long for my 3 year old to figure out which toys belong to which bin. Cars go on the blue bin, trains in the red bin, etc. Perfect for kids and now he is better with clean up time.
__label__2 the sisterhood of the traveling pants: i can not get enough of this book. i read it over and over again. ann brashares leaves you wanting more. i hope she will continue the traveling pants adventures and stories because they are just so amazing. lena, carmen, tibby, and bridget all show what freindship is and it's not fake. they are all interesting characters in the book and all have amazing stories. i loved this book so much, i can not get over it. if ann brashares does not write more i will be upset because she is an amazing writer. she captures the reader's mind while they read about the four girls. i can't wait for another book.
__label__1 first ever Logitech product to fail me...: Logitech products are known to be of prime quality and in a gamepad I was expecting something well made, responsive and accurate. Well, none of this are to be found on this gamepad. I believe and I think is a common notion nowadays that the best PC gamepad you can have as of today is the XBOX 360 PC compatible one. Don't look elsewhere.
__label__2 Joe Louis Review!: The DVD arrived before the due date in new condition as advertised. I'd been wanting to see this documentary for a few years but wan't able to due to my job location. I'm very glad I bought it I learned things that I wasn't aware of about what was done to him by our government.
__label__2 Excellent (actually 4 1/2 stars): I've had this CD since Dec. 1999 and it remains one of my favorites in recent years."The Dolphin's Cry" is a stellar song,and easily the crown jewel.The other radio hits"Run To The Water"(mellow) and "They Stood Up For Love"(catchy) are fine songs and worth checking this CD out for. This Live CD has a overall warm,spiritual, mid-paced, yet very powerful feel to it. I really can't say that there is a bad song on this disc, they all have a quality sound with lots of subtleties in both the music and singing."Sparkle","Where Fishes Go" and "We Walk In The Dream" are some of my favorites. Another fine Live Cd.
__label__2 AN ALL TIME CLASSIC: People of all ages love this story. It is currently a movie and a book and both are equally fantastic. The Last Unicorn has been my favorite movie for as long as I can remeber. This movie will never leave you stranded. It has all the elements a fantasy story should have. Buy it while you can because this movie will remain for years to come and the longer you wait the more expensive it will be. This movie is a true classic.
__label__1 Not a good read for the beach...or anywhere else.: I bought Hannibal to read on the beach while on vacation. I kept reading but also kept wondering why I wasn't interested. I'd put the book down and have to force myself to pick it up again. I did not find it entertaining, thought provoking, scary, or even worthy of mindless beach trash. The only thing that surprises me is that folks out there are still buying it. I don't get it.
__label__2 business card holder: nice size. Decent quality and good value for the money. Fits easily into small spaces.
__label__2 Dreaming of more...: Gordon didn't have a 'good experience' while recording this one...yet, it's classic Lightfoot...Dream Street should have been one of his biggest sellers.
__label__2 Lasergun Music hits its Target: MMMMMMMMM...........why doesn't all music sound like this again? Sneaky Bat Machine is the project of a very very fun man named (of course) Sneaky Bat, formerly keyboard player of DarkBeat labelmates and not quite as fun people Narcissus Pool. This stuff is CRAZY fast techno at speeds approaching 180 BPM with those little horror touches that sooooooo complement lyrics like "Kiss Kiss the devil's daughter/trust me cause I'm a doctor" Sneaky sounds like the little brother of the guy from the Virgin Prunes, although he obviously owes a greater debt to Alien Sex Fiend( there's a song called "Boneshaker". ' Nuff said) and errrr...Apopgtygma Berzerk (so he says.....I guess i can KINDA see it.) Anyways...from the pink CD cover to the cyber artwork to the all around good good music. Definitely pick it up...
__label__2 Hunter Continues to Impress!: This is the fifth Stephen Hunter book I have read. I have thoroughly enjoyed each one. This is no exception. It offered a unique perspective from the past with Earl and in the present with Bob Lee. Like all of his books, there tends to be a bit of a stretch of reality at times -- but its all smart, exciting action. I look forward to reading the next Hunter novel. I highly recommend this book.
__label__2 Absolutely incredible: I was so happy with Dolly's "Hungry Again," and her return to real country. I like new country -- but now it is just like pop music. Quite a few one-hit wonders. But Dolly Parton, like Tori Amos and Ani DiFranco (two that came to mind), makes an entire album of great music, instead of an album that showcases two hit songs. If you like folk/indie music, I think you will love this bluegrass album. Her cover of Johnny Cash's "I Still Miss Someone" gave me chills. My favorite song is definitely "Will He Be Waiting For Me." This is bluegrass, but I definitely like a female singing it. It just mellows it out. Dolly has now put out two great albums and with rumors of her possibly going on tour, I couldn't be happier. I'm 26, have been listening to her since I was little, and have never gotten to see her perform live. But this album, the critics aren't just praising a country hall of famer -- the album deserves every wonderful word.
__label__1 Huge Disappointment: If you've ever read any of her other books, you'll find that many of those "theories" presented were regurgitated in this book. She failed to remain objective and I felt like she was pushing her ideas down my throat. I'm not even sure she proved her point on what this book was supposed to be about. I was too annoyed with what felt like whining for someone to believe every word she said and if she got to her point I missed it. Maybe she was being pressured to release another book too soon and just threw this together. I've enjoyed her other books but I wouldn't recommend this one.
__label__1 If Only...(I hadn't picked up this book): So, I admit it. I read If Only. And I also admit that I cried. I wept mostly for the lost time, but I also shed a tear or two for the wasted potencial of this book. I'm not a Spice Girl fan, but I do admit that tumoltuous lives intrigue me. Marilyn Monroe, Princess Diana, Geri Halliwell. The memoirs are rambling, redundant and incoherant. Between the fluff, however, are moments of joy, sadness, and insight. Brief moments, mind you. If you're willing to to read through fluff without wearing the rose tinted glasses of a Spice fan, you may find it worth your time. Not likely, but one should never say never.
__label__1 Deserves no stars: Just another of the many books on the market that were written by going to a bookstore and reading everyone else's books for inspiration, then making up the rest of it. Talk about a meme gone wrong. Did this person study with anyone competent? Unlikely. It's so full of bogus information and malarkey. Don't waste your money.
__label__2 LADY KILLERS is the best: Please do not belittle the LADY KILLERS! It is definitely the best(!!!) of all British comedy movies. KIND HEARTS comes in second; LAVENDER HILL MOB brings up the third. (As to MAN IN WHITE, I do not know why it is included here.) Anyway, order this set right now before it fades away again.
__label__2 RR oval pot review: Very happy with my purchase. Continue to look at Amazon products and I am sure will make more purchases in the future.
__label__1 How to build a watch and more: I suppose this book might be just what some people are looking for, but I found that it went into such minute detail that I finally quit trying to read the book. I'm surprised that this book is recommended as the first one a person should read if they are a Seth beginner. I personally don't think it is a great benefit to know the "physics" of a soul (so to speak).
__label__2 An indispensable collection: To answer Robin S. Smith's questions about the contents, it is indeed the collection of works from jazz giants such as Jelly Roll Morton, Billy Holiday, Sarah Vaughn, Louis Armstrong, as well as lesser known singers.The five disc set it divided into sections called "Steeped in the Blues", "Straight out of Church" "Let's Have a Party", "Swinging the Songbook", "After Hours", "Jazz Compositions", "Scat and Vocalese", and "Novelties and Take-offs". Included is an excellent 100+ page book by Robert J. O'Meally which is almost as valuable as the recordings themselves.Highly recommended.
__label__1 Won't stay inflated: After my first bed failed, and after some back and forth with the manufacturer, I received a second bed. I'm sad to say that I've had the exact same problem with the replacement which is that it will not stay inflated overnight if a child is sleeping in the bed. In both of the beds we've had, air seeps out of the area near the inflation point which indicates a design or manufacturing flaw.I really wish this bed worked, and maybe they just have a bad batch at the moment, but I must advise against buying it.
__label__1 This book was blasphemous and heretical: This book was so disturbing I found myself wondering how the author could even call himself a christian. In addition as a member of Gen x myself I am appalled at how off he was in his accessment of my generation. We are not a bunch of MTV, grunge, goth groupies. Most of us are fairly normal people who do not fit these discriptions at all. I am sick of these pseudo intellectual professor types claiming to think they know who my generation is.
__label__1 Really...: They restore this on blu ray in amazing bluray for a near $150, which for a dvd set is a lot to shell out, so i pirchase this. VERY disapointed in this... The picture is grainy, worn, shaking, audio is hummed and for dracula has no restoriation. The creature from the black lagoon is descent but Frankenstein and Dracula... Horrid transfers.PS- these are all the 1999. Re issue dvds just in a set... Great films with bad picture quality
__label__2 Henry V (1944): Olivier inhabits the role of Henry with dazzling gusto in this rousing, energetic adaptation of William Shakespeare's play. The world was at war in 1944, and the gifted actor/director hoped the Bard's climactic tale of beat-the-odds triumph would comfort and inspire embattled England. Filling shoes once meant for William Wyler, Olivier's direction of his actors and the Technicolor battle scenes is sharp and inspired (with help from editor Reginald Beck). The movie's stylized opening in a re-created Globe Theater eventually gives way to beautifully scenic realism, an ingenious blend of theater and cinema that helped win Olivier a special Oscar for "outstanding achievement."
__label__1 I gave it a Fierce try: I picked up a few of Tom's books recently. It was just the urge to read an author whose work I'd been familiar with only by name. I had been warned about Tom's liberal use of simile and metaphor as I tore into Still Life. That was an amusing read on the beach. But it all got to be too much to handle in Fierce Invalids. The clever and amusing passages were fewer, and certainly farther between. We made it to about page 220, and were somewhere in Iraq I think, or wherever our jaunt led us from Turkey. "The desert spread out before him like a giant pizza." Or something like that. Oh brother. "Siwtters sweltered, but did not sweat." I gave up.
__label__1 Not a GE part: The product shipped was not the product I ordered. The ad clearly states, "General Electric WB21X5243 Infinite Burner Switch. by General Electric" The part shipped was a 5500-512 replacement for the GE product. I have not installed it yet. It may work just fine, but I would rather have the exact part I ordered.
__label__1 Britney does not have staying power!!: This CD is horrible. I truly wasted my money! Britney Spears is not an artist!! She needs to give it up! I don't understand the over hype of her. It's nonsense.
__label__1 Worst horror movie that has been made in a while.: First of all, when you take Friday the 13th, one of the lowest grossing movies of all time, and mix it with A Nightmare on Elm Street, bad things are bound to happen. They've been talking about making this film since like the 18th century and now have made it. Since I am like the only person on this review board who has actually seen this movie, I am definetly a reliable source. I'll tell you the ending. Freddy's head is carried by the Jason Vorhees. Yes, very stupid. But what's stupid is that they are making a sequel. Only this time they team up to fight some other guy. Evil and Evil VS Evil! They should like make another Home Alone movie with Macaulie Caulken and have Freddy and Jason be the robbers and like Macualie Caulken could like trick them and stuff. SWEET!!!!
__label__1 national geographic mag. sharing information: i agree i was ready to order for a friend & myself UNTIL i saw they put your life in anyones hand that wants it why would i do that to a friend oh well @ least they tell you upfront
__label__1 waste of time and brain cells: I just don't get it. These so called "Punks" sound like nothing more than NOFX wannabes. Except NOFX has more talent and a lot more orignal sounding. These guys have horrible lyrics. I just don't get how these guys go the reputation they've got as the best politcal punk band of the decade just because they can say "F*** Religion" 8 or 9 times in a song. They don't know about anything. They are insulting to all politically sound persons in the world. They shouldn't have quit their day jobs, whatever those jobs were. The song "Ska Sux" is especially stupid and insulting and just proves that the(y) know nothing about music.You want real punk? Try some of the following: Dead Kennedys, NOFX, Rancid, Operation Ivy, Blitz, U.S. Bombs, Dropkick Murphys, Sex Pistols, The Business, Bad Brains, Gorilla Biscuits, Minor Threat, TSOL, and the Germs (just to name a few).
__label__1 Still Haven't Received Book: 30 days after shipping and 4 emails to the seller later and I still haven't received my book. Wonder if they plan on getting around to it before the semester concludes?
__label__1 Broken Hearted Pasta Maker: We love this machine, but it continually breaks down. The plastic parts are too brittle for the pressure that this pasta maker places on them. We have waited many times for parts, and we have waited too long on the service line needing help.Look for another machine that uses steel or metal parts that won't crack, chip or snap when making the machines pasta recipes. Best to you!
__label__1 Ugh, the worst ever!: This "movie" is B-A-D. I'm a big fan of cheezy sci-fi noir, and enjoy atomic-age paranoia movies, but this one scrapes bottom. I can't think of any aspect of it to recommend, except maybe the lady screaming. On second thought, I can recommend using this DVD as a wind chime, or maybe flinging it a barking dog. Too bad it can't be given a negative star to damp some of the more favorable reviews...
__label__1 Why, dolby 2.0 ??: I dont'like this product, the video quality is bad and the sound is bad too, this is like a pirate dvd...
__label__1 Don`t buy this....: some decent crime stories, average actors (at best)....would have been an ok review untilthe final episode with kindergarden writing: Police headquatersis easily taken over, because every body gone at a crime scene, cell phonessuddenly disappeared ?? so rizzoli and isles can`t call for help.ending with incredibly simple-minded cliffhanger.....Who in the world writes these things?
__label__1 TERRIBLE--RUN AWAY!: A complete waste of money, not even worth seeing. Not even worth one star--but Amazon.com doesn't give an option for no stars.
__label__1 Beyond the blue horizon - Lou Christie: I ordered ( and payed much ! ) for the cd album : " Beyond the blue horizon / More of the best of Lou Christie ".Especially for the song : "She sold me magic ".After a few weeks I received an 2nd hand album of Lou Christie : "Beyond the blue horizon / Hey you cajun " .A whole different album , other songs and NOT my favourite song included ! Someone has cheated me and let me pay TOO MUCH for that cd! I do not like this !
__label__1 Disappointed: Based on the reputation of this bakery, I purchased the book. I made 2 recipes from this book so far and have been very disappointed. Looks like this one will gather dust on the shelf.
__label__1 I am hungry for more: The title of this album was exactly what I was feeling after listening to this album. I expected a lot more out of Banks. I bought the cd hoping to be one of the best hip-hop albums of the year but it turns out that it was sub-par. I know you have probably heard this many times but I have to agree that Banks is just full of punch lines. I espected this album to have the beats from get rich and die tryin with some good lyrical content. I am disappointed Banks could have come ten times harder
__label__1 No: This is the only book so far of James Patterson that I didn't like. I have read almost all his books. I stopped reading after several chapters. Service was good though.
__label__2 A pretty ring: This ring is very pretty, a little more sparkly than the picture indicates. The quality is appropriate for the price. I returned it because it was a tiny bit too small, in a way that told me the next size up would be too big - pity.
__label__2 Great Fun: A solidly written, nicely plotted, well told series, with engaging characters, an disingenuous heroine and the standard elements of romance, adventure, mystery and excitement. The real hook is the main character, Sheila, portrayed as an ordinary girl who gets sucked into an alternate dimension of magic, unicorns, sorcerers and righteous, sword wielding women rebels. What young girl does not find this a delicious tale? A plain old fun read, addictive and cheesy, but better written than many and with some very good interpersonal development between characters.
__label__2 Best Yet: I have never reviewed any workout DVD before, but I was so impressed with this one I had to let people know. I have bought previous Dancing with the Stars workout DVDs before, and if you're in the right mood they are a nice modest workout. This one, Ballroom Buns & Abs, is much tougher and much more enjoyable. Coming from a dancing background, I love that it feels like an actual routine versus just learning steps and doing them consecutively, AND that the routines are fun! If you want a dancing workout video with good cardio and toning, give this one a try. You won't be disappointed,
__label__1 Novel Still Missing: I ordered this book b/c I saw that it had received almost 5 stars. I was quite unimpressed. A 15 year old boy has sex in the room where his mother died with a kidnapped one month old lying quietly nearby. A little ridiculous as is the rest of the book.
__label__1 dangerus?????????: i wus trying to stapil my papr and then booM??it wont work after 5 time staple and when i try to make it work my fingr start bleeding,,,,,,,waste of money cant believ this.
__label__1 Complete Garbage: One star is an exaggeration. This program did not work from the start. For their customer support I was on hold (at long ditance rates) for 20 minutes, then I got dumped. I recalled and talked to a supervisor who gave me BAD advice. As far as I am concerned Protools/digidesign is very expensive garbage. DO NOT BUY THIS.
__label__2 Cute, Funny, Cheesy: This is definitively not everyone's kind of movie, but it reminded me of those cute cheesy 80's movies that are both campy and funny. You got the quirky and cute Kristen Ritter, and you have adorable Alicia Silverstone, who at first I was a little hesitant to watch. (Shes a mouth feeder, who knows what shes capable of!?)... I was delighted and happy after watching this...and that's all this movie is... entertainment. There are not profound meanings or philosophical type thoughts that will arise from this film...unless you want to talk about man's mortality and the possible idea of living forever...Sigorney Weaver in my opinion, should have had more face time...but then again, I'm no expert.I gave this a 4 out 5 rating because I love camp and cheese.I love stupid movies both ironically and seriously.The movie was like a Buffy episode... very Joss Whedon-esquewhich reminds me, If this were a tv I'd watch it for sure.The ending was cute too...that's my review and ims sticking to it.
__label__1 small infant book: attention to those ppl looking for a great deal.... please be mindful when ordering these that they are the very small board books... unfort i did not realize this when bought them.. very disapointed child on xmas.
__label__1 A great movie that screams for remastering: I'd read the reviews, I consider myself forewarned about the quality of the DVD, I never expected this, they should be ashamed of charging $15 List for this, I'd feel like I was paying too much at $4.99.When the theatrical trailer actually has better quality then the movie presentation, it's a sign something is wrong. The menus are 100% better looking then the quality of the movie itselfThat being said, this is a movie I've been meaning to get back and rewatch, and the story, the plot, the action, was all as good as I remembered, but WB owes those of us who bought this version free copies of the eventual remastered version that someone needs to have made.
__label__2 rafa,s purchased: i like these 4 product, but in next time i would like if u have the body lotion from jean patou, ill will appreciate, thanks .Rafael Rosado.
__label__1 Hard read: This book was not easy to follow and didn't really have a plot. I would not recommend this book to anyone!
__label__2 All the difference:): Only thing I regret about this pump is that I've waited so long to buy it. As many other Moms I went thru some manual and cheap electric pumps just to realize that if I really want to be successful with breastfeeding for long time I have to spend some money. I love this pump and personaly recomend it to all nursing moms. It may seem expensive but if you think how much money are you saving on formula each month it's really not that bad and very much worth it!!!
__label__1 An (unwelcome) Change Came: Beware; this compilation has the watered down version of "A Change Gonna Come." The version to seek out has Cooke singing about being discriminated against on the basis of his race. Three stars deducted for dishonesty. The rest of the songs are, of course, great.
__label__2 WORKS WELL FOR ME: I've used MyPDF Maker for several months. In the past, I used Adobe Acrobat Pro extensively but my new office can't afford it. MyPDF Maker works well from every application that I've tried it. I would prefer to have Acrobat Pro, but given the pricing difference, I'll continue using MyPDF Maker. It does a more than satisfactory job.
__label__1 Pretentious and silly: This is a book for sensitive college girls who see faces in the moon. For the rest of us, though, this book is ridiculous. The use of mythology is interesting, but degenerates into laugh out loud scenes of bare-breasted women chanting and summoning snakes. Furthermore, Washington is a poor choice for a setting, since it is NOT an old city, even by North American standards.
__label__1 I've found better endings lurking inside used tissues.: I admit I'm not a fan of Stephen King, but I will say Stephen King is very talented at bringing his characters to life. In all his novels I've read he has masterfully delved into the psyche of his characters; creating a very original and believable cast.HOWEVER, this book, like all his others, had an ending that made me feel cheated out of two days of my life.A COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME!
__label__1 It's different: don't make this your first L & H movie.: This French-Italian production has Stan and Ollie inheriting a South Seas island and discovering uranium. The bad news is that Laurel & Hardy were seriously ill during production (in some scenes Stan looks awful), and everyone except Laurel & Hardy is badly dubbed in English. On the bright side, there is some good visual humor; Laurel & Hardy do an excellent job considering the language barrier and production problems. Interesting as a curio and historically significant as the team's last film, but not a prime example of Laurel & Hardy comedy. This title is available on a number of video labels; the Madacy Video version suffers from the extended-play recording.
__label__2 more mature than cruel shoes, almost as funny: Steve Martin has come a long way since the seventies. He has honed his skills of writing and wit, and in doing so, he has attained a new level of comedy. Pure Drivel is the humor of the snooty New Yorker, and it is the humor that takes a little more know how than the Jerk. The wackiness is still there, and the megalomania is still there. But I think that there is a step in the dry direction that works beautifully with this work that is a step away from the gut wrenching laughter of Cruel Shoes.Although, I couldn't breath for a good five minutes after reading his public apology. Steve Martin is a genius... if Steve is reading this, let it go to your head, I know it will anyway.
__label__1 No Audio Out: It only splits a video source, but no audio. How dumb..... No where did it mention it as a video only source. HDMI is supposed to do both...
__label__2 Great training tool: This product is good as a introduction to archery for Juniors. Good as a training tool for young children. Fiberglass construction is good.
__label__1 LACKS PRODUCTION VALUES: I don't know if a laser version exists; or if it does - is it any better? What seems like a good story falls by the wayside when viewed on this grainy, murky video-tape. Politics demand an aborted Mars mission go on as planned, except, it shall be done on a soundstage. Oddly ironic as one watches a fictional account of a fictional event being fictionalized on flim! Dreadfully ironic as one watches co-star Orenthal James Simpson run for his life! Probably a good copy could catch a few bucks at E-BAY though. That is, if a good copy exists!
__label__1 Outdated: This is a Winsock 1.0 primer. There is a hastily-written ending chapter on 2.0, but it is far too brief.In short, this book was a disappointment and is badly in need of a new edition.
__label__1 Techni Ice packs: I bought several of these packs, based on the recommendation of a user at a trade show. However, they do not seem to stay cold any longer than an ice block, for example, and take up at least as much volume as ice. Also, the packs leak some slimy stuff that quickly covers everything in the cooer, so I had to place each pack is in its own plastic bag to contain the slime. What a nuisance. I have reverted to using ice.
__label__2 Musical Opiate: This is by far the best Orb disc, and my 'most played' album ever, by far. There is something magical about this disc, as some members have attempted to explain.It hits you, it fills you, and it moves you. I remember listening to this in college and having many odd experiences. Listening to this album, while sleeping, will also give you the most vivid dreams imaginable. Its music that truly escapes, transcends, and numbs you. Clear your mind of all and have a listen, you won't be disappointed.
__label__2 Unforgettable work -- hard to believe it's really fiction: 'Year of Wonders' is a fantastically well-written novel based on the real English village of Eyam, where fictional residents chose to seal themselves off from the rest of the country in an effort to quell the spread of the plague in 1665. As conditions in the town worsen and the residents begin to die overnight and in mass numbers, resident and widow Anna Frith must help the Mompellions cope with the disasterous effects of disease, fear, religious zeal and murder. While the book was far more graphic than I expected, I was very affected by it -- it's not a novel you'll soon forget. I found myself doing a lot of research on the Plague and English history after finishing Brooks' fine work.
__label__2 Informative and touching: The Monks of New Skete are truly devoted to their dogs. I learned to anticipate my dogs needs and to partner with them in this life,so that all will benefit.I highly recommend this book to both new pupppy owners and those who have had dogs before,You can teach and old "dog owner New tricks".Jan Mahan
__label__2 stainboy says: Another Aerosmith compilation. A big bunch of really good songs, but maybe too many. For an Aerosmith fan it is perfect, but for a casual Aerosmith listener like me...too much. I really only care for about 8 or 9 songs on this CD. Definatly Janie's Got A Gun and Cryin', also Love In An Elevator and Dude Looks Like a Lady. I like a few others as well but the rest don't get me into my groove. I give it 4 stars. This is stainboy signing off.
__label__1 Crazy Pet Bumble Ball: This ball was a piece of junk. It didn't even last 5 minutes before the batteries were dead.
__label__2 Great product: I needed a cheap, reliable coffee maker and this was just the fit. I was a bit scared of breaking it the first time I tried to make coffee due to all the reviews of people previously doing so, but the press is quite sturdy (still, it is made out of glass after all and you should be careful with it). The beaker is removable from the stainless steel stand, so handwashing it is very easy.
__label__2 I vote for this book: Even though I am a student not a teacher I really like this book. My mother bought it for my teacher but I read it and I wish Louann Johnson was my teacher. She cares about kids just like in the movie Dangerous Minds. If the president would listen to her I think we would have better schools insted of just a bunch of stupid tests. I want to go to that dream school. If my school could be like that it would be really great.
__label__1 Joe - Oh No!: As a Joe Jackson fan, this comes off as a major dissapointment. Joe pulls off a fairly uninspired striped down live album recorded at NYC's Joes Pub. While it's nice to hear some of the old standards again like "One More Time" and "Hometown", he also does Duke Ellington's "Mood Indigo", which sounds out of place and sung painfully. His version of Steely Dan's "King Of The World" sounds strained. He should have put in "Any Major Dude" which he did so much better at The Bottom Line a few months before this gig. His musicianship is still very good, but you're left asking what's the point of this record? We can only hope that we get more of his quality stuff in "Night & Day II" due this fall.
__label__2 Great fun -- good display of PS2's capabilities: I really enjoyed MOHF, even if I had to refer to several web-guides to beat a few of the boards. The sound was fantastic, especially if you have a good some theater system. The graphics were great, but there were a few errors I noticed along the way. All in all, it was lots of fun and was pretty challenging, especially for a novice like me.
__label__2 The Best: I've been a GTA fan for a few years now and to me, San Andreas has got to be the best one. For the first time you can swim!! I fell into the water accidently and discovered this new action for the character. The graphics are more real making it kind of "funky" controlling the game but after awhile you'll get used to it. The language is terrible (more so in this GTA version) so young kids should avoid this like the plague.
__label__1 Ultimate? Hardly!: I was and am a true fan of the music of Eddie Kendricks throughout his years with the Temptations, and his solo career. To the producers of this collection, I say, someone is just trying to make some more money off of a talented singer who died in his prime. This is not an "ultimate" collection by any means. To me, to call this "ultimate," one would have to make it a box-set of all, or at least most of Mr. Kendricks' solo recordings. Please, give us a better selection of his work. In fact, why not just re-release all of his albums on CD? What we have here in this "ultimate" collection is practically the same thing that has been previously released on the "At His Best," and "Motown Superstar Series" collections, so what's the difference except someone is after profit? Please don't defame the memory of Eddie Kendricks with this offering!
__label__2 Thrill: This movie is sure to give u an adrenaline rush. Well filmed and presented. Val Kilmar is convincing in his role . Beautiful Cinematography.
__label__2 This is a great CD: What a great CD, it has all the best tracks that Vonda Shepard has preformed such as: For once in my life and Alone again (Naturally). It also features guest apperances by: Sting, Al Green, Tina Turner, Barry White, Anastacia, Tom Jones, Chanyanne, and my personal favourite, Robert Downey Jr. I think that Robert and Vonda have such amazing talant in their voices and they accompany each other so well when they sing Chances Are.
__label__1 Unfortunately boring!: I read two other Connie Willis novels - Doomsday Book, and To Say Nothing of the Dog. The latter was a great read, and even pointed me to Jerome K. Jerome's wonderful book "Three Men in a Boat", written in the 1800's.Unfortunately, this one didn't come close. Great story, but unforgivably tedious. It's rare that I don't finish a book once started, but that was the case with this one. I just couldn't muster enough concern to dredge through the story to find out what happens at the end. Too bad.
__label__2 That was a Christmas gift for a child: Everything arrived on time, everything worked, kids love it. That was the greates price ever too. Very popular among kids
__label__2 The best invention since Toliet paper!!!: This charger is fantastic, you just pop it in you cigarette lighter plug and in no time you battery is charged, Wont run down you Auto battery, Doesnt burn up batteries lilke other 12v chargers.Fits my need perfectly. 3 people have bought them since the seen mine work.Dont be hesitate, buy it now!
__label__2 Great teaching aid: I teach High School Psychology and this book is very useful as a practical/interpretive guide to the raw definitions of various mental disorders as described in the DSM-IV. If using this in the classroom, make sure to preview each "case study" because some are difficult for novices to relate to the diagnoses. Overall it is a very approachable book and a necessary companion to the DSM-IV.
__label__1 INTERESTING INFORMATION BUT EXTREMELY BRIEF: There have been endless numbers of books written on childhood development to the point where some books contradict others. It is no wonder parents can become confused when it comes to sorting out what is good advice and what is not. This book does provide some very basic guidlines to follow when raising children, but the book truly does not give readers what the title implied, a thorough understanding of children. It is highly questionable if any book can do that, particularly one that is so brief with just over two hundred pages. The book was rather sketchy and lacked sufficient detail to be of tremendous benefit. On the positive side, what information the book did provide made for quick and interesting reading. As for understanding children, as both a parent and one who is a counsellor, I would have a difficult time recommending this book as an abundant source of worthwhile information.
__label__2 its a good product: I am very happy with my over the head earmuffs. They fit real well and look good, well worth it. They seem to be quailty made which is very important to me.
__label__2 awesome: ninja's , blood , gut's and gore , I wish that it will be released unrated or uncut I will definitely buy it again .
__label__1 This is not your old Leisure Suit Larry: One of the first games I played on my PC was Leisure Suit Larry I (and then II and III). These were played with the keyboard, and you had to type in commands.This latest incarnation has very little in common with the originals. Whereas the originals had some clever humour and puzzles, the new one is more of a mashing the buttons / get your timing down type of game. You will be chasing gold coins down for the most part.There just isn't enough to this game. The puzzles are very repetitive, and the control leaves a lot to be desired. Stay away from this one, unless you have a need to own every LSL title.
__label__2 Blends historic photos and details: A Good Camp: Gold Mines Of Julian And The Cuyamacas is an informal hand fascinating istory of the San Diego gold rush of 1870, and provides the reader with a lively cast of local characters blended with a geology of the region and an exploration of early mining processes. The result is a history which blends historic photos and details of a Southern California mining spree.
__label__1 Ceiva Provides No Supprt: I gave this to my parents for Christmas. While they love the idea of the frame, they cannot get it to work, and cannot get in touch with a human being at Ceiva to look into the problem. My Dad has been on hold for over three hours trying to talk to a person to help, but never gets connected. If I could get my money back, I would.
__label__1 Kinky. And not in a good way.: I know the kink-free hose is a myth, but I expected this "kink resistant," relatively expensive hose to be better than the cheapos I've bought in the past. Instead, it's one of the kinkiest hoses I've ever had. And it's very heavy, which would be acceptable if that kept the kinks out, but it doesn't. Very disappointing.
__label__2 A Hit in the Whole Neighborhood: Bought this for our kids, 9, 4 & 2. They are all having a blast playing with this toy. Very simple and easy to operate. My 2 year old daughter can put the missile to the blaster and send it off with a foot. It is not bad for under 15 bucks. It comes with 4 missiles that is as soft as a nerf. Wont hurt even it hits you on the face. The pump is sort of a rubbery plastic. My older kids can shoot it high as the roof. When we are playing this outside our townhouse neighborhood, all the kids can't wait for his turn. A sure big hit.
__label__1 freaks: How can humans have such pure evil in them? The innocence of a child is destroyed by such abuse, why do you think there are so many mentally ill people out there? It IS ABUSE, no other way around it!!! It is sad, sick, discusting, and evil. Those people need to be taken away by men in white coats!
__label__1 Horrible: This album sucks. Boring guitar, bad vocals. If you can't sing, don't hide behind effects, just don't sing or hire a good singer. Stop with the played out harmonics. This guy is capable of so much more. There's a few spots where his guitar playing shines, but mostly uninspired pinch harmonics that don't make a song. Where are the songs??? Weak, weak, weak. I want to like this guy but his music isn't living up to the image he's projecting. I can barely make it thought the first listen, infact I'm shutting it off now. I made it to Spread Your Wings and said please stop. This is not hard rock, it's not really even music.
__label__1 Stuff you already know...": This was required reading for a nursing class. I diligently plugged through the Chapters but there was not a lot of "valuable" new information. It provides some history of nursing and related figures but most of the guidelines are common sense. Unless you have to buy it, save your $$$; however, I will say the authors of this book have put out some GREAT mnemonic flash cards for a variety of nursing topics (meds esp) which I LOVE and use regularly so def. check those out!
__label__1 CROSLEY CR248 SONGWRITER CD RECORDER: THIS MACHINE SEEMS TO WORK O.K. , BUT THE SUPPORT FROM THE MFG. STINKS. THEY CHARGE 9.95 FOR 12 PLASTIC 45 INSERTS THAT YOU CAN PURCHASE 60 FOR $7.00 ON E-BAY. THEY OFFER A BRUSH AND REPLACEMENT NEEDLES FOR OTHER MACHINES, BUT NOT FOR THIS MODEL. THE SUPPORT IS VERY IMPORTANT WHEN YOU ARE PAYING SUCH A PRICE. SOMEONE NEEDS TO NOTIFY THEM OF THIS FACT.LEN SCHIFF
__label__1 This is the best they could do with the Hawk engine?: I played the demo featured on the THPS2 disc and laughed. I doubt Runecraft will be getting much more work from Activision based on this performance. The skateboard has been replaced with a bike and the rider models changed, but that's about all that seperates this one from Hawk 1. That, and the fact that it's impossible to land. And the motions look terrible. And just generally not fun to play. Oh yeah, they left the skateboard sounds in - very strange.If you're in the mood for a bike game, go buy Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX. It blows this one away in every category.
__label__1 PLEASE do NOT buy this product: I bought this for my daughter last June for her birthday. (2008 model). We used it twice last year, and on our 2nd inflation this year (ie. not EVEN 4 uses total), it would not inflate.... on inspection I found that a 2 ft section of the INNER liner had come away from the slide wall itself, leaving me ABSOLUTELY no way to fix/patch it. When I rang TOYQUEST to inquire about this problem, they basically told me that I was out of the 60 day warranty, and basically - tough !! They obviously know their product is sub-standard and are unwilling to stand by it !The 3 times my kids did use it, they DID have a blast, but, I would have rather spent the $400+ on annual passes to the local water park !!Please do not waste your money on this !
__label__1 A bad film: there's not too much to say on this film, except bad acting by virtually everyone, an uninspired score, cheesy effects and mundane dialogue. if you want a really believable alien film, try "monster" which is currently on amazon instant.
__label__1 If you need to cram for an exam, don't buy this!?: I got this book used from a friend : he said it was no use to him.I read it and even with a broad background in acoustics,systems dynamics, physics and mathematics, I could barely make head or tails of it.Stuff like curvature and matrices are universal, but what this lacks isexplanation that to comprehensible to a new comer.Since I used the physics Schaum's outline to get me through college physics whenthe Feynman text was the "new" physicsand my professors were just jolly bad,I say this to help not harm.If Schaum's company wants to help:assign a new guy to write a better outline!If your text is bad and your teacher is badand the teaching assistants are clueless,this book won't help you.
__label__1 Flattens to nothing: I bought this pillow with the idea that it would give support during sleep. It doesn't. The pillow flattens down to more than a regular pillow does, leaving no support at all. Don't buy this pillow.
__label__1 Review for A Primer For Disaster Recovery Planning In An IT: The book has very little meat to it, although it has 200pg it ends on page 100 and gives you a bibliography. It does not go deeply into how to develop a disaster recovery plan. The second half of the book pretains to irrelevant information.
__label__1 Flat: I enjoyed Hannah's style but none of the stories were particularly memorable. My favorite was the Civil War story, "Knowing He Was Not My Kind Yet I Followed." Overall, solid just not to my tastes.
__label__2 Great resource: Everything you ever wanted to know about maternal nursing in an easy to read college text. Keep this one for reference.
__label__1 incomplete and no priorities: Like many such lists of things to do, this book has good information but is incomplete and has no priorities based on what will do the most good in which situations. It is not likely to help many people. Too many books like these entertain people and lead to no action, unfortunately. There are much better books -- by Daniel Chiras, David Johnston & Scott Gibson, John Krigger & Chris Dorsi, and Daniel K. Reif -- to name just a few. Chiras has written quite a few, all very good.
__label__2 Simple Plan Rocks: If youre into bands like Good Charlotte, Green Day, or Blink 182 then you should definitely get Simple Plan's album. Especialy if you like Blink and Good Charlotte, since some of those guys guest star in this album. Addicted,My Alien, and God Must Hate Me are just a few of the great songs on this album. If you love new punk music then you need to get this album.
__label__2 Don't let the cost sway you...it works!: I bought this bracket in order to work with my 700-R4 GM transmission with my Holley 670 Street Avenger carburetor. At first, I thought it was crazy to spend that much when they make cheaper universal brackets. DO NOT use a universal bracket. They are cheap, and flimsy. This product is SOLID. It is very sturdy, matches up to the carburetor perfectly and does not bend, sway, move, etc. Works perfect!!!
__label__1 Poor Sound - ok for light listening: If you like any music with bass, these will not work. If you like to listen to music a little bit louder sometimes, these will not work. There is a lot of crackling if you do either. They're great for light listening while doing housework or sitting outside. I returned these because they won't work for what I was trying to do.
__label__2 Excellent item: This cloth does a fine job polishing my Case knife! I use it often and enjoy knowing this is an American-made cloth and knife. The cloth quickly and easily cleans the blades and has no problem with a bone handle. This coupled with a Case patch makes a very nice gift for someone or for you.
__label__2 A great perspective on the treatment of mental illness: A wonderful autobiography from the eyes of a child who lived through a cutting edge treatment for his disorder in an era when mental health was never addressed with children. Uplifting and inspirational.The courage displayed by the author is to be commended. " For those who understand, no explanation is necessary. For those who don't understand, no explanation is possible." From a parent of a current Orthogenic School student,this author makes the explanation possible for all.
__label__2 judge and jury review: The first few pages weren't too exciting BUT by about page 5, things really started to jell and the action was non-stop.I could hardly put the book down and kept reading it at night until my eyes almost went shut. I finished it in a couple of nights. The story revolves around mafia hit men and those who have been chased, cornered or know someone close who was killed.I know for sure I NEVER want to get involved in as a member of the jury in a mafia trial.
__label__1 too much missing data: I do not recommend this book to anyone. It is sketchy and it keeps pointng you to the internet to accomplish simple tasks. The whole purpose of buying a book is to not have the aggravation of hunting on the net. This author also seems very confused, especially in the beginning. Had it not been for data I hunted for on the net, I would not have been able to install the PHP, MySQL or Apache. Take for example, after installing Apache, she mentions that you need to first configure Apache via the httpd.conf file then does not tell you how. She then goes on to the next section of installing PHP leaving you to figure out how to get Apache working. The MYSQL for me did not install either; I had to download a copy off the net.Too much missing data in this book.Marc
__label__2 Off the hook!!!: This album is of the hook! Anybody who buys it will be satisfied! And if you don't like Trick, then you got some very big problems! Don't forget to buy his next album THUGS-R-US! The new single off that album " THUG" is the bomb for real! So go out and get both the cd's NOW!!!! For real!
__label__1 Best song missing...poopie: The one song I wanted is not on this disc....the best song in the whole movie....the tango song ....that really stinks
__label__2 awsome sport drink: hands down the best sport drink out there. has no sugar and is actually has a good amount of potasium.tastes good, not overpowering or anything like gatoraide. just adds a mild lemon lime flavor to your water.
__label__2 Wiesenthal's words make you define the meaning of right: Simon Wiesenthal's book, The Sunflower, is a true life story of a Jew called to the bedside of a dying Nazi to hear the Nazi's life story. The Nazi then asks the Jew, Wiesenthal, to forgive him. Wiesenthal leaves in silence, but poses to you the same question: In his position, would you have forgiven the Nazi? A very thought-provoking book, The Sunflower makes the reader ponder for hours over the meaning of right and wrong, as well as giving a vivid picture of a Jew's life during the Holocaust. An excellent read.
__label__1 Cat loves it but dye runs: Our kitten loves this but the green dye ran all over his mouth/paws. I'm glad I noticed before it got on our light furniture and carpet.
__label__2 War of The Worlds: Hi I think this is a great movie and have always loved it seen it in 1954 and saw it 3 times then...It is hard to beat old movies..
__label__2 A kick in the pants -- in more ways than one: You may have heard some of this advice before, but you've never heard it quite like this. Aura's sassy humor, personal experiences, and, yes, client tales bring fun and pathos to the insights about life that most of us need to be reminded of regularly throughout life. This book is easy to read straight through, but bite-sized chunks make it useful for picking up and flipping through any time you need a kick in the pants.
__label__2 Hard to find CD: This is a special CD which needed to be replaced. The going rate was too much money. Then I looked at Amazon. They did the search for me, and when it became available, YAY!!Thanks!!!
__label__1 Michael Birkins a liar: Solitaire my ass. You are playing against Michael Birkin. And he is good. My record is 4-362. Whats next, Solitaire Battleship?
__label__2 Great!: I really liked this book & crayons. User friendly for all ages. Easy to clean off and less messy to use.
__label__2 Very stable: Excellent quality. Very stable . I ride indoors twice a week for a hour. This device is perfect for keeping my bike steady.
__label__2 Mann's Monument: One of the most well-researched storylines in the genre, and a good experiment in new digital filmmaking technology. Fast-paced milestone capturing the high of going as far and as deep undercover as oxygen allows...
__label__1 Do not!: Do not waste your money. It might be a better idea to go to the pedi place and enjoy your $30 put to good use.
__label__2 China: 100 Years of Revolution: Excellent book. It covers a whole lot about the first 100 years of china's change from an imperial government to a republic/communist type of a government.
__label__1 Software-mediocre at best. Customer Service - "-0": Worst customer service I've ever dealt with. Stay away from any of this company's software or products!
__label__2 It was THE BEST!: Kate Wilhelm did an excellent job in putting this book together. The characters where describe well, and the book was suspensful. I read this book in 3 days. I really wish that my teachers would use books like these, instead of those boring books, for assigned reading. It makes reading much more enjoyable. As you go along you also find yourself trying to solve each problem. FANTASTIC!
__label__1 Shedding?: It has been about 3 weeks of using this product, and I am still losing about 5 hairs each shave. It has become much, much softer, but I don't know about the shedding- leaves me a little suspect as to the quality of the knot. I have read many reviews on this brush, and some shedding within the first short while is normal, however, this extended period of shedding isn't right...might be just me.The brush was really stinky when it came, however, a cleaning protocol- hot water with Dawn soak for an hour, hot water rinses (30 min each) x3, hot water with vinegar x 30 min, and then 2 iterations of 8 hours sitting in lather worked like a charm. No smell any more (other than Proraso!)
__label__1 Speedy Ambience no Star: The fires depicted have a strange color. The only menu item with fire sounds only is so huge its scary. Music blasts on most menu selections. The fires burn too quickly as though on fast forward and I can't really see any HD effects. I cannot recommend this DVD. I would like to return it.
__label__2 outstanding: This helpful book is full of God's wisdom! God has used Dr. Colbert as a vessel to convey truth to me and my family regarding walking in Divine health! This book does not delve into "new age" teachings, as others have accused. Obviously, they have no spiritual discernment. This is VERY sound, VERY Biblical advice!
__label__2 All Alone in the Ocean: I really liked this book. It was amazing of the things that happened on the Frog and how it didn't sink. All the things that it went through like the storm and the shark and how hard it was all alone in the ocean. It was a very exciting story. I think this book has lots of excitment.
__label__1 Tie Ropes too small: The ones available in local stores have longer tie ropes that extend to your belly. Its easy for tying. The ones that I ordered from Amazon have short ropes and its hard to put your hands behind your body and fumble with the knot. Its particularly hard for elderly persons who have Arthiritis ot Tentenitis.
__label__2 Suspenseful Story...recommended viewing: I read many of the reviews of this movie before purchasing the DVD and seeing it for myself. I was prepared for it to be just adequate from the previous reviews I saw, so I was pleasantly surprised to find a very gripping storyline, with great characterizations.I enjoyed Susan Porter and Kelly McGillis' chemistry, they have some sizzling scenes on here...I am in agreement that Porter is what makes the movie so interesting...she's a great talent.Definately worth renting, and I'm not sorry I bought the DVD.
__label__2 Loved it: This was my first SJ book and I didnt want it to end. I have been looking for the magic of this book in her other books but have not completely found it.
__label__2 Best for hot coffee!: I bring this tumbler with me to and from school literally every day, and my coffee stays hot the entire time I'm there. Doesn't spill, doesn't leak, keeps my hot beverages hot and my cold beverages cold. Well worth it, highly recommended.
__label__2 fantasy but fun: Predictable but allowable. One falls right into the trap of this romantic and fabulous film starring two most amazing film stars from another era. It was great to see Vanessa Redgrave looking so attractive as a mature woman. Ditto for Franco Nero. Its is especially intriguing to know that they were once married in the real world. This film is pure fantasy and fun. Nothing deep to talk about over the water cooler but nevertheless, charming.
__label__2 Wonderfully splendid!: This book features very sexy, wonderful knit and crochet patterns for all women of all sizes! I began crocheting right after I paged through the book! I want to make almost everything in it!! If you are an adult female looking (or even a cross dressing man) to exude your sexuality and turn heads, this is the book to do it with! The woman who designed and created these patterns is a fashion diva (in my humble opinion, of course) who should definitely keep designing all things glamourous and sexy!
__label__2 Office Gift: These were a suprised gift to my staff for christmas. The quality of the stapler and smoothness of using it makes their job less stressful on theirs hands
__label__1 Greg S.: Was happy to find this item at amazon for better price than local retailers plus free shipping. However, item arrived damaged and note on box said to call manufacturer directly. Manufacturer suggested that they mail me replacement piece and fix myself or lug item to one of their shops. When I complained of lack of professional customer service, then the agreed to come to my home and fix on site. I returned the item and will not purchase one from a company that does not offer to do the right thing the first time around. They should spend a little extra on proper packaging for shipping purposes if they would like to keep customers
__label__2 My personal favorite "vi" quick reference: This "pocket reference" is one of the best available and is inexpensive, too. I bought several copies to have them around at the various computers...but they keep turning up missing because everyone takes them back to their desks...this is the most often "lost" publication I've ever bought next to SSCs C Library Reference! I highly recommend this for all but the most guru vi-er...and a definite requirement for every aspiring vi learner. Oh yeah...be sure to tie a rope around it if you want to hang on to it at the office :)
__label__1 Anything for a buck.: This is the stuff of black helicopters. Nothing in this book can be substantiated. Hersh is a fraud. This book makes me question Mai Lai. Some investigative reporter, a rank rookie stung him with fake Monroe letters. Take back his Pulitzer.
__label__2 Nice tether w/cheap lock: The Kensington 64343 MicroSaver works well, with one complaint: the lock itself is difficult to use. On the back of the lock is a T-shaped tab which fits into the slot on your laptop computer. The tab has a little pin on either side, which need to line up with the tab in order for the tab to go into the slot. It's possible for the tab and the pins to go out of alignment with each other. When that happens, you'll spend a long time fiddling with the lock, trying to get the tab and the pins back to the way they're supposed to be. This is probably due to cheap construction of the lock mechanism - it ultimately gets the job done, but can be a pain to use.
__label__2 This CD is good but.....: I really wish they would come out with a 2nd CD with all the songs performed in the movie. Most people I have spoken to about this all agree. I hope you agree as well.My favorite song wasn't on it and I was very disappointed. When I listened to the whole thing and the ending song wasn't on there it was a shock. Ewan's voice gives me the chills and that song is one of the best he sings. Other than that I LOVE THIS MOVIE AND CD.
__label__1 Beavis and Butthead: Let's be serious. Though funny at times, this must be the Beavis and Butthead guide to girls, dating, sex and relationships...
__label__2 So Glad to FInd This PILLOW: I have been looking for about 3 years for this type of pillow. My husband thinks I'm crazy for liking such a dense, firm pillow but I love it. I have had neck and shoulder problems in the past and this is a lifesaver. When it arrived (very promptly shipped from Amazon), it seemed too light...I thought this will never work. But when you lay on it, it firms up under your neck and head. It is fabulous, no sinking into it...your head rests atop the pillow and your neck is cushioned. If you like a soft mushy pillow..Do Not get this. But if you are looking for tremendous neck support, this is the one for you...and added bonus...It doesn't smell funny like the memory foam type. It is perfect!
__label__1 LOOKS BETTER THAN IT WORKS...: I WOULD NOT TELL ANYONE TO BUY THIS ITEM UNLESS YOU WANT IT FOR LOOKS. I GOT MINE AND YES IT IS VERY VERY CUTE BUT IT NEVER WORKED CORRECTLY. THE TOP OF THE CUPCAKE IS FAR TO HEAVY AND IT DOESN'T MOVE WHEN YOU SET YOUR TIMER. IT WOULD NOT MOVE MUCH AT ALL IN FACT SO SAVE YOUR MONEY AND BUY A CHEAPER ONE...
__label__1 Easy read: It is an easy but boring read. Story is slow & characters aren't that developed. I only read it because it was the December selection for one of my book clubs.
__label__2 roberts: I say they were a good value and price was a factor as in most anything else I buy these days.
__label__2 Gainesville punk: Good collection of songs from this now defunct Gainesville band. If you like these guys check out other Florida bands like Hot Water Music, Radon, and Discount.
__label__2 All of the books in this series are excellent!: The lessons in the books of this series are classic,timeless and very much needed at this time. I wish every parent would read them to their children.
__label__2 vintage Clarke: I don't think I've ever read a Clarke book that wasn't first-rate; this is no exception. It depicts the wardens who herd the giant whale groups that provide a substantial portion of the future earth with food. Like all his books, it flows effortlessly and ends beautifully.
__label__2 trimmer very nice: This is a very nice trimmer and the light is kind of cool, you could also use the light in an emergency and have some light!! Very nice and quiet also!!
__label__2 Good Music: I really like Jann Arden and recently purchased this CD to add to my collection. Very good purchase!
__label__1 Collection of trivialities boringly written: The main idea of this book is straight-forward: why wouldn't developping countries export branded goods instead of raw materials, to get sustainably richer. Then it is followed by the numerous recipes and guildelines how to do this from a person who clearly has very vague understanding of the modern commercial realities.The text is heavy and boring often overloaded with not relevant and not linked details. I expected the section with the real life cases to be interesting and motivating. However, the cases are given on very generic level.Despite the well-known author, the book is a collection of trivialities. Government policy parts are stronger, unfortunately the author focuses more on the export business development
__label__1 A Disappointment...: The book is geared towards those with a basic understanding of the Russian alphabet and pronunciation in order to use it. If you have no understanding of the Russian language, do not buy this book. I suggest you sign up for a language class or a more comprehensive Berlitz course. This book is not for amateurs even though it is written in a very simple and concise format.
__label__1 Slow, Slow, Slow: My wife and I lisened to this book on tape during a recent trip. The best thing I can say about it is that if you happen to fall asleep for 15, 30 or 45 minutes when you wake up you'll find that you haven't missed a thing. The story is somewhat interesting but it's so slow that it's hard not to just give up on it and if we'd had another book to listen to we would have.
__label__2 A rough start, but still very good: Like the first Harry Dresden book, the first few chapters of this book are a little awkward. The dialogue and descriptions do not flow well, at first. DO NOT give up on the book picks up and comes together quickly after that awkward section. If this series is anything like the Dresden series, there shouldn't be anymore awkwardness after this first book.
__label__1 High-minded gobbledegook: After reading the reviews here, I could not wait to see Rushmore. I tried to place the hype out of my mind while watching. I was thoroughly disappointed. Yes, Jason and Bill acted their parts well. But that isn't saying much considering their roles were those of completely unlikable people. The plot was lame lame lame and without merit. What troubles me even more is the number of people who would rate this film as a "Classic". Hogwash. The extras are interesting, but it is difficult to be interested in extras when the film is completely uninteresting to begin with. Rushmore was a dud. Watch it once. But be most entertained by reading the reviews here.
__label__1 Who is this frau?: Gee, I think Ms. Trotta would like to be given credit for the assassination of an American senator, eh? She would have felt right at home in Nazi Germany, where calling for the death of a political opponent was completely acceptable.Why are we stuck with these monsters? How can we get them to climb back under their rocks???
__label__2 Excellent: This book is my second fav Steel book. Beginning near the depression era and progressing throughout WWII it talks of life of an American woman living in France. It's the typical Steel story, where it goes through an entire life of the main character until her death. I love Thurston House, but this one is a close match to being #1. If you like the WWII era and add a bit of romance and overcoming tragedy throughout a lifetime, then you'll love this one.
__label__1 If you buy this phone GET INSURANCE!: I have had this phone less than a year. I have had it replaced two times so far and have, the whole time I have owned it, not had a full month of this phone working properly. Right out of the box the first time it had speaker problem and did not ring. The next time people would call me and not be able to hear me, but I could hear them. The main reason I picked it was because it has a camera.The camera could be better, but for the price, is not too bad. The phone does go through power very quick. Any day I talk on it I have to charge it.Although I have had many tech problems with this phone, it seems to be strong physically, nothing on it has broken, including the screen on the front. It also has a nice sized color screen.So if you buy this phone, just make sure you keep up the insurance and keep track of your warrenty info because it will need to be replaced.
__label__1 Big disappointment.: This is the most boring movie I have ever seen, BAR NONE. I think one reviewer hit it on the head when s/he said it was two hours of people sitting around looking at each other and not saying anything. The premise of rooting out the treasonous mole is interestng, but there is so little action (or even movement) that it will put all but the most loyal viewers to sleep. The one bit of action that finally occurs at the end is so overdue that I personally didn't even care anymore when it happened. I just wanted it to be over. Not my cup of tea... (British-ism intended!)
__label__2 Great keyboard, versatile, but odd spacing: Compared to other keyboards in the price range, this Apple model is rather nice. I have Windows machines and Macs and use this keyboard with both. I like the built-in hub and the firm keys. The key spacing is a little different though. It's something you'll need to get used to if you're used to more traditional pc keyboards. The keys have a nice firm spring to them, and the unit itself has generous rubber feet and a satisfying heft. If you're considering this for your PC, keep in mind that the Windows key is the same as the Command key, and that the control, Command key and alt keys are in a different place than found on a pc keyboard.If you have an older Mac and are not running 10.2, don't fear. I imagine the 10.2 requirement is just for the volume up, down, mute and eject keys. I've used this keyboard with a iMac and a B&W; G3 under 10.1 and 9.0.4.
__label__1 Yawn, snore; what a bore!: Simply one of the worst books I have ever read -- didn't evenbother to finish it! The writing was sophomoric and simplistic, andthe story line was just too pat for me to deal with. I was far from being transported back to Florida or North Carolina (and I'm quite familiar with both those places). On the contrary, I felt this story could have taken place anywhere -- which was a let-down for me. Thank goodness I got this one out of the library and didn't waste my money!!
__label__2 Nice finished product: I followed the directions on the can and my project turned out very nice. there was no foul fumey odor. the drawbacks are that this product is very thick and dries very quickly and was difficult to mix thoroughly. I suggest that if you draw a pattern on your wall like I did to keep it fairly simple because the thickness and quick drying makes it difficult to be precise with fine lines. I used the entire can which was at least a dozen coats because the closer I got to the bottom of the can, the more magnetic particles there were, therefore giving much more magnetic strength from the bottom contents. I feel that these particles sink down to the bottom very quickly no matter how much time is spent mixing. if I was to do my project over I would dump out half of the can and set it aside and use the bottom stronger magnetic portion, therefore skipping half a dozen coats to apply.
__label__2 Gourmet and simple: It is a beautiful cookbook, many excellent photos, sample menus (also with photos) and a range of recipes that range from the easy to those best tried with cooks who have some experience. The photos also include ingredients in their natural state so you know what they look like when you go shopping. Recipes include lentil shepherd's pie, vegetable terrine, Japanese flower salad, vegetarian moussaka, rose cheesecake, and old-fashioned treacle tart. So why only 4 stars? Because there's a recipe missing, the very first one I wanted to try: Cucumber and yogurt soup, p. 138. It's listed both in the index and in a sample menu. However, recipes of that sort can be found in many places, including online so, while irritating, the book is still solid.
__label__2 JUVY AND CA$H MONEY REPRESENT THE DIRTY SOUTH: I think this is a great cd. I love rap music especially CA$H MONEY and NO LIMIT because they are from the south and I can relate much better than most of the New York rap. And f*ck the haters and the bustas who wanna put it down just b/c they're on top. Lot's of people from the south go through the same things that are talked about in this album and it's realy neat to know that. Anyone white, black, pink, green, or purple should have this album.
__label__1 Useless: Frustrating, gets all kinked up and very hard to manage. If I weren't so lazy I would send it back.
__label__2 beautiful: This TV is great. picture quality is awesome. I also have a 42" 1080p projection of another brand. Picture quality in both is so close you wouldn't know the difference. But the richness in the color of the lcd is unmatched.
__label__2 Ppractical and Useful: Dr. Fairchild has done a great job in presenting the foundation for perioperative practice. This is a superb review for the nurse thinking about taking the CNOR because it is in such a readable style.
__label__2 The truth of the Faith: This is the book that convinced me of the truth of Catholicism and convinced me to convert from Anglicanism. While Keating does get bogged down quite a bit in responding to and shooting down fundamentalists, this book clearly and calmly works through basically every Catholic/Protestant disagreement and shows, very often directly from Scripture, the truth of the Catholic position. Incredibly convincing.
__label__1 Not a good quality product: Shortly after purchasing, the screws in the top began to call out and the piece would collapse. Poor quality, will not buy another one again.
__label__2 Durable and roomy: Has lasted about 600 hours worth of dog walking/jogging. Just now getting ragged. Holds mini-flashlight, tennis ball, vaccination papers, business cards, lots of poop bags, cell phone, a little space left over.
__label__2 Pure and sweet...: Ever since I saw this movie on cable in 1982, it has been one of my favorite stories of pure and sweet young love. I watch it whenever it's on. I recommend this for any "romantic" who is young at heart. And I don't understand why Matt dillon NEVER mentions his work in this movie when he is interviewed. Well, maybe his movie preferences are different from mine, but he was great in this, as was Cindy Fisher.
__label__1 Damaged: When I received the chi it was working fine the first time. Then it wouldn't show that it was heated up. I noticed the metal plates were coming out. I pushed them back in and it now burns my hair. Complete waste of money.
__label__1 A nice work of fiction: This book is rife with statistical fiction, most of which springs from the author's huge bias against adoption. According to Ms. Carangelo she is a birthmother whose son was stolen from her for adoption as well as the mother of a child supposedly stolen and switched with a stillborn infant. As bizarre as those stories are, they more closely resemble the truth than any of these so-called 'statistics'.
__label__1 Cloud Atlas: cannot recommend this book, found it to be a very tedious read, mislead by hype, should have considered more carefully
__label__2 Baby loves it! Would recommend!: I checked out a lot of different baby sign videos from the library - this was the only one my baby son (then at 7 months) really enjoyed. My son is not hearing impaired, but I just wanted to get him started on communicating. He would smile when he heard the intro music and liked to watch me sign with the video. He would also dance to some of the music. He would grab for the remote whenever he wants to tell me he wants to watch this (this is the only video we let him watch). They use classical music and show real images as well as toys for the words (for example, "cat" they show pictures and videos of real cats and also toys shaped like cats. They also create some animation for some of the words too or use puppets to show an interaction (like "share" or "help"). My son is one now and has signed "more" "all done" "milk" "eat" and understands a lot of what I sign to him. I would recommend this all three in this series.
__label__1 I don't like it: I thought this was a good book, but it was not good for me. There was no introduction, and most of the instructions in the book were in English, so i wasn't helpful to me trying to learn Spanish.
__label__2 Content is good. Format is distracting.: Marcus has written a great book here, no doubt. But I have to be a simpleton when it comes to the style. The pages are sort of split with 2 stories going at the same time. It does get to be a distraction. That aside, I would recommend this book for those not easily distracted. Veganism is the best lifestyle. Cheers.
__label__2 Rotten teeth, rotten schools - telling it like 'Tis.: It is worth reading this book just to find out why a woman told teacher McCourt "No kid o mine gonna be no yoot." (p. 318) Things you don't want people to know about America let alone made so readable are here. Without being convicted of any crime children are sentenced to years of feckless cruelty , and the wardens (teachers) are demeaned . English lit is at the very best just dreary busy-work. Enormous waste. We should know already that Frank McCourt is clear, blunt , lively and yet pleasant to be with. Here he presents the autobiography of a bad man, a drunk, resenting his work, ignoring a good woman - but leaving out the part about getting even. People who write about themselves usually take the opposite tack. So that's a great plus. And he leaves loose ends, that's another. My hope is that every so-called educator in America will get the beak , priceless message in Tis.
__label__2 Book Order: Needed the book for class. A bit pricey, in my opinion. Shipping not as fast as I would have hoped. But book is in perfect condition. I really can't complain. I'm just picky. Overall, best price available for the book on short notice.
__label__1 a sorry college level text book: This book is required for a Finance course. This is one of the worst college level textbooks I have ever been exposed to. I am taking this course as a requirement for a 3rd college degree so I have bought a few textbooks.There are answers to every other problem and not one explanation as to how the answer was derived. Oh wait!!!, you can buy the accompanying student workbook and there are some semi-explanations there.If this book is intended to be a teaching tool it has failed. The authors deserve an F and should reconsider themselves as "professors" or educators.My university will hear about this total waste of money.Authors (of this book), educators and others: feel free to contact me and I will elaborate. I will also offer suggestions and solutions to better present the material where this textbook fails. [...]
__label__1 "Road to Riches" Is An Incredibly BAD Movie.: If you like really BAD acting, really BAD scripts and really BAD production values, then "Road to Riches" is the movie for you. I bought this title at a dollar store and it came in a high-quality box, so I don't feel totally ripped off.The other 1-star reviews tell it like it is. Watch this bomb for free if you can, or try to find it at a dollar store. If you find it for $1, you will come close to breaking even because you can keep the box and use the DVD as a coaster. That's what I did.
__label__1 Gueee: You need to keep buying it and using it to keep cats away, not worth it.. Not good for other pets or your backyard.
__label__2 Creating Your Home Creative Window Treatments: This book will make a good addition to any home sewer's library. It's written with a clearly British flavor (flavour?. The instructions are clear and easy to follow. How to's for most of the more common types of treatments are addressed. The authors describe hardware options and illustrate several unexpected and very clever ways to dress your windows. The artwork and photography are well done with some useful decorating suggestions demonstrated. It's not limited to only fabric. Several types of non-fabric treatments are included with some easy to duplicate painting techniques. This book would make a great gift for a new bride or a young person moving into there own place. I'm glad I added it to my collection.
__label__2 Trafic finally gets the presentation it deserves: If you have made it this far, you will want to own this DVD. While not one of Tati's best, it is still an entertaining and charming movie. The extras alone are worth the DVD price: interviews with the cast and a fascinating interview with Tati himself, who reprises some of his best mime routines. Regarding the movie itself: I was stunned at not only the quality of the picture (sharp with bright colors), but the fact my VHS tape was missing about 15% of the frame on all four sides, not to mention having a horizontally stretched picture. So, aside from the much-improved picture quality, there is actually 15% more movie to see! Buy this DVD (and the others from Criterion, if you don't have them), and show Criterion that their efforts with regard to Tati are appreciated.
__label__1 I have bought four....never again!!: I have bought four of these batteries. I feel like a fool after reading so many bad reviews. Please look for an alternative. Out of the four batteries I have not gotten 20 hours of use. It is sad that a company as Fisher Price would sell such a mediocre product. The ride on is nice, please look for an alternative on replacing the batteries.
__label__1 Poor attempt at continuing a previously excellent series: Do not make the mistake of buying this book. It does nothing to further the storyline in the initial Wheel of Time series, instead, it chooses to create boring, frivolous sub-plots and add even more non-essential characters. The characters you loved in the initial books in the series are ignored, while the story flounders and no progress is made. Mr. Jordan has succeeded in cramming 6 pages of relevant action into a 1,000 page book, hoping that we'll all be foolish enough to buy "just one more" to see how it all ends. Don't do it! It's incredibly sad to have so much potential wasted, but it appears greed has got the best of Mr. Jordan as he hopes this "cash cow" will continue indefinitely.
__label__2 Among the imposters: Among the Imposters was my favorite book I read this year. This book is the second book in a series about ilegal third children. The main character is a ilegal third child who was in hiding for pretty much his whole life. He was lucky enough to get a fake ID but, his name which was Luke is now Lee Grant. One day he was a poor farm boy now he's a filthy rich baron. His new rich parents send him to a school called Hendricks school for boys. His life their goes from boring to exciting after he finds a special place , usualy terifieing for third children. Personaly, this was one of the best books I've read. I liked this book because I think it would be interesting to live in a world where third children are ilegal. To find out more read Among the Imposters.
__label__1 Sound quality is poor.: The man is great, his music great, this dvd is ok, sound quality is bad, buy a cd or some mp3.
__label__2 Great camera shame about the software: The camera is a great performer but the software provided is useless as it does not contain the required drivers for Windows 98 or 98SE as it states on the literature. Trying to get information about these is like trying to get blood out of a stone as Arcsoft.com who write the literature for the Mass media Storage device etc. do not want to know and refer you to a Tel. number and are no help at all. So it is impossible to connect the camera to a PC using either the provided cradle or a direct link form camera to PC. As you can imagine I am not happy after paying out a considerable amount of money to get the latest camera and finding that you can not get prints out of it.ABE
__label__2 Bidato is a treasure not to be missed.: Bidato is a collection of poetry with amazing depth and complexity. It captures the bitter-sweet reality of the contradictions of life. Duane BigEagle intricately weaves incredible depths of sorrow and regret with accpetance, hope, and celebration of every-day humanity...The human heart may never have been so complexly portrayed and beautiflly exposed.
__label__1 Not for everyone.: Although I thought the guitar riffs and melodies were very creative and very catchy, I found King Diamond's high-pitched screeching was headache-inducing. This ruined the listening experience. Those who don't like high-pitched vocals and those who are prone to migraines probably shouldn't buy this.
__label__2 ONE BAD #%& WATCH: To the point, this watch it's perfect, this is my third G-SHOCK, first one died on me at a pool after i changed the battery, second one after 8 years of abuse, started to fall apart but the watch still works, so i decided to treat myself to a new one. This one it's exactly what I need, alarms, timer, and built to take everything a throw at it, sin ce I work in shipping, this one should do the job.THANKS ALOT CASIO!!!!
__label__1 pulsar flight computer watch: this watch is totaly unreadable and should be withdrawn from the market.
__label__2 A "must read" for anyone who cares about true diversity: Wienir and Berley's "Diversity Hoax" provides a disheartening glimpse into the state of American higher education. It illustrates the hyperbole and closed mindedness that passes for free thought and reasoned discourse at Berkeley. But more importantly, "The Diversity Hoax" exposes the current gilded notion of "diversity" for what it is. Berkeley students, professors, and administration evidently celebrate diversity of skin while shunning diversity of thought. Currently a senior in high school and aspiring lawyer, I will soon face the seemingly Sisyphian task of standing up to the radical liberalism so prevalent on college campuses. I only hope that I will have the same courage as Wienir and Berley to speak my mind and fight for true diversity.
__label__2 it's great!!: Music is one of the most important things in my life. "If You Leave Me Now" is my favorate song that I have ever heard. I loved Chicago the first time I heard them. All their songs are great!
__label__2 A LIGHT-FOODED COMEDY, AND IT WORKS!: During a 5-month trip through South America I picked up several Grisham books, and "The Rainmaker" was one of them. Unlike most of Grishams other works, this story is more of a comedy than a page-turning, edge-of-the-seat- thriller, and a rather risky change from his otherwise tailor-made novels, but it works! The story is VERY funny, and I can't remember the last time I have laughed out loud so much while reading a book. Sometimes the humour is almost Dickensian, and that, I think, is somewhat of a compliment. It is also nice to see a change in the type of hero. Instead of the usual Mr. Perfect, Rudy is a somewhat unsucessful, insecure and average guy, and the character development is (as usual) admirable. The problems with his landlady make up some of the funniest parts of the book, and it is some of the funniest pages I've read in ages.There are no killers luring in the dark in this seemingly harmless story, but beware... you could just die laughing!
__label__2 On Kindle/Computer to listen to Music: This album is well worth the download and minimum cost to own. Would suggest this to all listeners and is a great addition to classical Russian music collection.
__label__2 NICE TOOOL: This tool is a must for working on CIS fuel injection systems. It is easy to use. However, it could use longer hoses so that you can be in the car and watch the gauge as you crank and start the enguine. Otherwise, works great and not a bad price.
__label__1 Catholics BEWARE!!!!!!!!!!!!: It's not my favorite book of all times but it did strike up my curiosity and make me think.Being a Catholic I could see all the points being made and understand a lot of why Mary did what she did growing up and going to the convent and her choices for leaving. Also, somewhat like Mary I wanted a child at any lengths and if I were to never get married I would've done exactly what she did. In the 1990's it just wasn't as much of a scandel as the 1950's. It also brought up a lot of valid challenges against the Catholic church as well as pointing out that things aren't much different with time. The Catholic church is still the same although women are some what of a more active now.If you are looking for something that questions faith and argues for and against it this is the book to pick up. Even though I wasn't overly pleased with the book I did get caught up in it BUT in the same sense I wanted it to end.
__label__2 he likes it: I am a picky tea person. Mostly I only drink loose leaf tea, and find the idea of bagged tea unappealing. (As my dad used to say its the stuff that fell on the floor in the factory). However, before I goto bed, I don't want to deal with all the steps involved, so I decided to give this a try. I was very surprised. Its a full flavored tea that I don't think could be any smoother. This is my second case, and I hope Amazon continues to carry it into the future.
__label__2 An incomparably moving film full of stunning images: This film goes way beyond documentary into the realm of art. As Herzog once said about a mountain, and as someone said about Herzog's work, it is "difficult ... dangerous ... ecstatic." It begins as a more or less conventional documentary about airships and one man's attempt to design a smaller and more maneuverable ship, but as it goes, it turns into a meditation on what this ship, the "White Diamond," means to the people who encounter it, from the engineer who seeks redemption for his colleague's death, to the village children who cannot "see" it, to the local man who wants to fly to Europe to find his family and cease being "a lost brother, a lost son." The airship is counterpointed with dazzling photography of the million swifts that fly in and out of a "Secret Kingdom" behind a waterfall, a flight that even the White Diamond cannot make. Other themes weave in and out -- levity, danger, and human emotion. The music is stunning. A superb movie.
__label__2 RICH'S MONSTER MANIA: YES I ENJOYED THE CLASSIC SCI-FI COLLECTION FROM UNIVERSAL.TARANTULA,SHRINKING MAN AND MONSTER ON THE CAMPUS WERE REALLY GOOD,JUST MONOLITH MONSTERS DOES SLOW DOWN IN PARTS.COULD HAVE BEEN A MUCH BETTER MOVIE,THE IDEA WAS THERE,AND THE MOLE PEOPLE WAS A FAVORITE OF MINE WHEN I SAW IT IN THE MOVIES WHEN I WAS YOUNG,IT WAS ON A DOUBLE UNIVERSAL BILL WITH CARURU BEAST OF THE AMAZON WITH JOHN BROMFIELD AND BEVERLY GARLAND.I RATED THIS 4 STARS AND I WILL WATCH IT AGAIN.WHEN COMPANY COMES OVER,BREAK OUT THE CLASSIC SCI FI.
__label__1 Sizing is the issue: I wasn't able to use it as the largest size in the variety pack is still too small for my coat. The larger (outdoor) kitZipper Rescue Kit-Heavy Duty might have worked.Therefore, cannot comment on this item usability.Be careful with the size you may need, although given lack of description on the item, it will still be a guesswork.
__label__1 Disappointing schmaltz, a waste of a great talent.: Gladys is one of my very favorite singers; I can't begin to voice how disappointed and saddened I am by her choice of music on this CD. Schmaltzy, treacle-y pap, not very interesting, and not using her fantastic vocal skills to the best benefit. I hope she turns her career around.
__label__1 nice concept, but more of a pamphlet than a book: This is a tiny book, more of a children's book than a resource for serious gardeners. It's attractively designed and laid out, but the informational content is limited. The information on selecting plants for a hummingbird garden is not entirely accurate -- for example, wooly blue curls (trichostema lanatum) are actually not "well-adapted to various soil types". Unfortunately that's almost all the book had to say about this beautiful but temperamental western native, which requires especially well-drained soil.Part of the problem is that this book doesn't address regional differences. Perhaps it would be suitable for residents of the east coast or Midwest. For residents of western states, I would recommend looking elsewhere, such as books on native plants or the Sunset guide to Western Gardens.
__label__2 Funny and though provoking.: IMHO Over the Hedge is the best comics strip out today. This is the one I don't want to miss. My only displeasure is that they no longer produce these collections. Join the suburban critters in this second collection.
__label__1 this book is so sick and waste my time and money.: I think the publisher has some problem. So sick book can be published here. How sick it is. Maybe the publisher never read Chinese authors'books. I really suggest, if you have not buy this book, don't waste your money. I regret I bought it when I saw the ads. The ads is so bad and gave people wrong information.This is not true Chinese life, Chinese culture and Chinese girls.
__label__1 This was stupid: This was a multi-million dollar movie that boiled down to a bad joke about Mexico closing it's borders to the United States. Ha ha ha.
__label__2 Good: Quick and e as y read. Pictures are to large had to continually turn book to see them. Good digital copy.
__label__2 Combat ! Season 5 Invasion 1: Finally Combat ! in Color Great packaging , easy access of episodes , interviews & show insights a plus . A must have for any Combat ! Fan.
__label__1 They sent a muffin pan!: I ordered a baking sheet, they sent me a muffin pan! The product was in a sealed plastic bag with a UPC sticker that said "Baking Sheet", but was actually a muffin pan. Now, I'm a guy who cannot cook and purchased the baking sheet for my wife, but even *I* can tell the difference between a muffin pan and baking sheet. The muffin pan was returned.
__label__1 UNoriginal!!!: A straight guy who wants to have a female-dominant threesome? Let's see: this has already been done in "Trois" and "Just One Time." Just as those movies stunk, so does this one. This movie could have been called "The Look-alike Film." The main character looked like he could have been Brendan Fraser's fatter brother. The Spanish student was obviously a Penelope Cruz imitation. In fairness, one guy may have been the actual tattooed guy from "Oz," the one on death row.This film says it has "sexual content," but it could have run on non-cable TV. There is no nudity whatsoever. The plot is predictable. I am in shock that a movie whose cover looked so titillating could be such a disappointment. This work really and truly lacked redeeming qualities.
__label__1 Be carefull what you buy!: Take heed boys and girls this is not a new Work, or a long read. This book is only 94 pages of 20-font reading. I complained to F Paul Wilson and he replied that this was not a rip off and that collectors love this sort of stuff. Yah, but I am not a collector and I do not appreciate spending $20.00 for a 15 min read. I do not blame Mr. Wilson but I do blame Publishing houses that try to sell short stories at full novel prices. The price of books is already too high as it is.Nuff Said
__label__2 I Love It!: It is a very educational video that shows kindness in the face of suffering. It is a great tool that can teach empathy for others.
__label__1 not what they usta be: Had perchused one of these 15 years ago in a combo pack. That was a great little rod,i had cought up to 4ib smallies,then last summer it finaly broke. So I ordered up a new one. At fisrt was impressed by the revisions to the guides. much wider than my original one. I did relize that the pole was only 4ft not 4'6. I threw on my little Daiwa Crossfire. I get to the lake to pick up a few sculpin and brim. First cast the rod snaped in two, right in the middle. Didnt even get to reel in the line. Just splintered and snaped in two. Only had 1/32oz weight.
__label__1 a waste of money: I didn't expect much since the product was so cheap. The buzzing is far to much to listen past. We used it for 30 minutes.
__label__1 Strong, terrible smell: I heard great things about this stuff so I went to the local drugstore to get some. I wanted unscented but they didn't have it so I got this instead. The oil itself is nice; I used it in combination with a body cream for these very dry winter months. However, the smell is truly awful and it consistently gave me headaches. Not only that, but the smell permeates through all layers of clothing and lingers until you wash them. I just could not get past the headache-inducing smell so I had to throw it out. I'm going to stick with one-ingredient, edible and non-stinky oils, like coconut or almond.
__label__2 My very own library!: I received a Kindle 2 for Christmas from my children! I love it! This is the greatest device since the laptop computer. It is amazing. I have been messing with it since Christmas. I set up my Amazon account yesterday to automatically purchase books. I purchased 2 this morning straight from the Kindle and it took less than a minute to download. This device is lighter than a paperback book and yet has the capability to hold 1500 active books. I love the way it feels in my hands while I am reading. When I take a break from reading and touch the switch to put it into sleep mode a different screen saver is displayed on the screen. Right now, I have a whole page of fish. This is fun. The other amazing thing is I can download classic novels for free! I cannot wait to travel with it. I will not have to stuff my suitcase with books anymore.
__label__2 Super affordable, less stick than hoped for: They get the job done for sure, but they do not have much re-stick power, and lose their stick after a while compared to other brands. Might not be an issue for some people, but I have a sticky system on my desk, so when they don't stick well it's bothersome.4 stars because it's super affordable, and you normally get what you pay for.
__label__2 Excellent field guide. Very useful: An excellent field guide for fishing or just general marine knowledge.I live in México and greatly appreciated that the author included the Spanish names for almost all the species.There is information on the edibility of each species and any that are toxic.The illustrations are all in color and very well done.Just the right size to drop into a Ziplock bag and take fishing.Overall, an excellent book. Just what I was looking for.
__label__1 FLORIDA: THE NEXT GENERATION REMOTE CONTROL EXTENDER MAY WORK, BUT I DON'T KNOW BECAUSE IT WOULD NOT WORK ON ANY OF MY DIRECTV HD21 REMOTES. RETURNED ITEM TO SELLER NOW WAITING FOR A REFUND. CONTACTED SELLER AND THEY EMAILED ME WITH ADDRESS TO WHERE TO RETURN ITEM. RETURNED ON AUGUST 21TH, STILL NO REFUND.
__label__1 Be aware: I order bare minerals about 2 month ago. I bought the starter kit and it cost me a little over $60. Two months later a new charge for bare minerals showed up in my bank account. I called bare mineral customer service and they told me that when I purchase the product on the 2nd page on the agreement it clearly states that you have to be a member to order the product and that a monthly fee is associated with it. This is ridiculous they put this on the second page almost toward the end so if you don't finish reading the whole statement they can take your money. Please make sure that you read the whole statement.If there product is good why they have to scam people like this.
__label__2 I'm not an audiophile: I'm currently in the process of following AJATT. Which means I'm creating an artificial immersion environment in order to learn a foreign language, which means I listen to a lot of my target language, close to 4-5 hours a day with these. These headphones are awesome, extremely comfortable, and very good at blocking out the noise. My head doesn't feel like it's been in a vice-grip after extended use.I'm not an audiophile so I won't pretend to be one, but these are the best headphones that I've ever used. They sound awesome, plenty of bass.They are bit clunky and not that portable, but that's not really their purpose.The cord is huge, thick, and coiled. Very nice if you have to get up and move around the room. It stretches plenty but doesn't get tangled because it's coiled.Not to mention that I notice them being used by professionals everywhere (camera men, sound guys, DJs, Radio talk show hosts).They come with a nice faux-leather bag with a draw-string to transport them.
__label__1 Not half the CD "Christmas Eve" is: If you're planning on buying this because you LOVE the Christmas Eve CD... Don't! You will be sorely disappointed. The original material on this CD is not very good, and there is very little Beethoven music. Without the magic of the Season to lend it beauty and power, this TSO release feels too contrived.
__label__1 Only symbols and images, no concepts!: This book does tell you some essential things about LINUX, but this is not enough at all. Being surrounded by pictures and tips, I really can't learn anything that concerns the main part of LINUX. It is no better than a thickened Redhat user's manual! Too Pratical! If you really want to "LEARN" LINUX, you'd better go and buy RUNING LINUX which is far better than this book!
__label__1 Was good in 1985: Today, albums like this sound outdating, repetitive and crap. I would agree with the 5 star reveiwer if we were still in 1985. Nowadays this kind of music is naff.
__label__1 SEE WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU GIVE GOOD REVIEWS - NO LONGER: I AM LOWERING THIS REVIEW SINCE THEIR HUGH 25% JACK UP IN PRICE. $1.25 A QUART IS WAY TO HIGH TO BUY ANYMORE.I am pretty much disabled and hate it when I run out of milk. I'm buying this so I have reserve on hand when it's to hard to go to the store when I run out of milk. The 12 3qt bags is a little more expensive but I figure it will stay fresher longer and I will probably only need one bag a month or so. I have heard Saco is a good brand. I will add to this review after I have tried it.--Update: IT WAS GOOD AT $36 A CASE BUT NOW IS A RIP-OFF AT $44. THE 40 QT BOX ALSO JUMPED TO $44 PLUS $13 STINKING SHIPPING. NOW YOU HAVE A HUGE HIGH PRICE. IT'S NOW WORTH BUYING THIS CRAP ANYMORE.
__label__2 This has been a very useful collar for me and my dog.: This seems to cause just the right amount of mild discomfort for Jonas to be able to understand that I want him to stop, or whatever...It is the only collar that has worked to train him...
__label__1 poorly and thoughtlessly made: The timing function and the bell work . BUT drop it , even on carpet, and it breaks apart into at least 3 pieces . And it will fall even if you don't drop it because the magnet that is supposed to hold it to the fridge , etc. when not around your neck , is so weak that it tends to slide right down the appliance and crash to the floor .In addition --or maybe subtraction -- the cord that is supposed to hold it around your neck is super scratchy so you won't want it next to your skin . Another junky thing made to look nice and functional but made so thoughtlessly and cheaply that it is nothing but a waste of money .
__label__2 It's Good: It's a very good vest. I only give it a 4 star because like the other reviewers said, it is a bit small.
__label__2 Truly Enjoyed!: I really enjoyed the plot, it kept me guessing where the author was going next. I am recommending this to my book club.
__label__1 Doesn't look like this: It doesn't look like this in real life. It's smaller and looks gold not copper. I returned it. I'm still looking for something that actually looks like this.
__label__1 i wouldn't rent it again nevermind buy it: I was very excited when I saw this movie at blockbuster.It had good reviews and looked interesting.However; the entire movie was unbearable.At times I almost fell asleep and asked myself why I was even watching it.My dad actually did fall asleep.The bottom line is this film is overated and boring.
__label__1 Disappointed with this slipper.: My husband had a pair of these several years ago, made by the same manufacturer. This pair is stiff and not true to size. At this price, the quality should be very nice. They even look cheap! He has tried to break them in unsuccessfully, so I can't return them -- I will never buy L.B. Evans again.
__label__1 I don't like this book: This book says to hit babies with a switch. They say to ignore a baby who cries. I think adults who hit babies and ignore them just shouldn't have babies.
__label__1 My Cats are too Smart: I didn't have a problem with the programing, although it didn't like the fact that you can't vary the amount of food in each portion at different times of day. My big problem was my cats (both of which are highly food motivated) figured out how to reach their paws up the chute and get kibble. I tried jerry-rigging different things to stop the stealing, but then they just would bang the unit on the ground and get kibble out that way. Not a great thing to wake up to at 2 am. I wouldn't recommend this unit to anyone.
__label__1 Good until the end: I thoroughly enjoyed this book until the last little bit. Having the main character be sent home so quickly was unrealistic, having Ted suddenly decide to become a music therapist was not transitioned smoothly and probably unrealistic, I didn't care for the late addition of new characters (nurses), one of whom just happens to sing and the cliffhanger with no warning was frustrating - I felt like it was just a ploy to get us to buy the next book. I would have liked to see more development of Alex's conversion and subsequent learning to live as a Christian. The fight between Alex and Ted to see who would get to make the "unchristian" nurse mad because they had permission to play the music was unchristian of them both. I felt frustrated because I did enjoy most of the book, but am not sure I'll buy the sequel.
__label__1 Our Gang + MGM = Bad Comedy: I'm amazed at the reviewers who have given this Our Gang DVD collection five stars. We're talking Spanky and Company at their worst! The first half-dozen shorts from 1938 are OK, then MGM trashes the series beyond recognition. Though Hal Roach stopped producing comedy shorts for economic reasons, it must have pained him to see what Leo the Lion did to his beloved property. If you are truly an Our Gang completist, then consider Roach's "Hide and Shriek" the grand finale.
__label__1 Might as well fan yourself with your hand and save on batteries.: I always rely on Amazon customer reviews - this is the first time I have been so completely disappointed. I had to hold the fan 10 inches from my face before I felt any circulating air, and that was with the fan on High. Due to the size and shape of the fan blades, no air comes out of the center of the fan; what little breeze there is comes out in a small stream on the sides of the fan. I won't comment on the light, since I wasn't interested it that option. Just got it, and I am sending it right back.
__label__1 Disappointing: I have to agree with a lot of you out there...I was considering to buy either this book or the one written by Keel, "All About Me". After flipping through the pages of both books, being a young adult, I found the questions in "The Milennium Memoir" to be simpler to answer, and could easily relate to. As I look back, they seemed a little to simple, and each answer did not provoke much thought and meaning.
__label__2 bonafide: This is one of the highest quality reggae videos that I have seen in years.The flow is on point,the music is good,and it can be enjoyed by dual sexes.Burst of energy DVD.Recommended to all.
__label__2 Looks great in my kitchen: I love this spice rack and my friends all think it's looks super great and professional. It's really kicked up my cooking as well having 2 of these racks on either side of my stove top. Makes me feel like a real gourmet chef. And I bought all my spices from a local spice market down in Pike Place, so once I threw down $50 on this hardware, everything else was next to nothing. I had no idea I could have such a high quality and customized spice selection for so cheap. Love these!
__label__1 doesn't hold a candle.: like the other people said, this CD doesn't do linkin park any justice. what is that scratching noise? is that linkin park country style? no. please don't even waste your money on this.
__label__2 Gets the job done: Worth the money. Pleased with the results! Head is not as long as an alternate product we found but it works well just the same.
__label__1 Disappointment: I attempted to download the required program to use the labels with my MacBook but could not access the program. I then emailed Memorex to find out if it was Mac compatible but got no response. It probably doesn't make sense to return them to Amazon due to the postage cost.
__label__1 Tastes terrible!!!: These bottles seem pretty sturdy, are decently stylish, and come in the right size, but when you go to take a drink all you smell and taste is metal!! It really tastes like a pocketful of change in your mouth and the smeel is unbearable. I had to give them back to Amazon and I ordered a Sigg bottle instead. Hope it works out...
__label__1 The Worst Book Ever!: I picked up this book thinking it would be suspenseful and maybe interesting. This book was nothing but confusing and left me extremely frustrated at the end. I definately do NOT recommend this book!
